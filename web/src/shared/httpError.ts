/**
 * One decoder for failures thrown by the generated OpenAPI clients.
 *
 * Each generated package (`generated/auth`, `generated/account`, `generated/scopes`, …) ships its OWN
 * `ResponseError` class, so `err instanceof ResponseError` from one package is `false` for an error thrown by
 * another (see the note on `withRefresh` in `features/account/login/login.ts`). Every decoder in the app worked
 * around this by duck-typing the shared shape (`.response: Response`) by hand — the same ~12 lines copied ~8×.
 * These helpers are that shape, once.
 *
 * Client error text surfaces in the UI and diagnostics, so — as the retired `apiError.ts` warned — a server
 * response body is only ever read for its machine-readable `code`; it is never surfaced verbatim.
 */

/**
 * Named HTTP status codes the client actually branches on — so a status check reads by name instead of a bare
 * magic number (audit #78 P4b). Only the codes some call site checks live here; add one when a new check needs
 * it. Response *construction* (e.g. the media service worker returning a `404`) keeps its own literal — this is
 * for the branching/decoding side, not for building responses.
