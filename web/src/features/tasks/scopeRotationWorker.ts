// The web worker loop for the **second** consumer of the operator-blind task queue (ADR 0021) — scope-rotation
// (cr-0092, ADR 0025). When a tenant owner removes a member co-sharing a GROUP the owner doesn't hold, the
// backend queues a SCOPE_ROTATION job (it can't rotate — it holds no key there). The next remaining key-holder
// online completes it on-device: mint E_{n+1}, chain-link E_n, re-grant the surviving members (reusing
// `rotateGroupForRemoval`, cr-0089), then complete. Claimed **globally across every held scope** — a key-holder
// sitting anywhere (even their own personal scope) drains queued rotations WITHOUT opening the group. Requires
// an unlocked vault (the rotation opens the caller's own grant on-device). Idempotent + first-online-wins: the
// backend leases each job to one worker and coalesces multiple removals into one rotation, so a second
// key-holder simply finds nothing to claim.
