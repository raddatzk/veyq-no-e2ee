// cr-0092 live e2e (VEYQ_E2E=1): the async group-key-rotation backstop, end-to-end against a REAL backend +
// MariaDB with REAL crypto — no mocks. Three actors on one instance (serialized: each `become()` swaps the
// session token + unlocks that actor's vault):
//   A = tenant OWNER (server owner + tenant owner) — the remover; NOT a key-holder of the group.
//   B = group key-holder (owns group G, holds K_SC).
//   C = co-sharer of G (a key-holder after grant-delivery) — the removed member.
//
// Flow: A removes C from the tenant → the cascade cuts C's co-shared G membership and originates a
// SCOPE_ROTATION job (A can't rotate G — A holds no key there). A/removed-C cannot claim it; B (the remaining
// key-holder) claims it via runScopeRotationWorker, mints E_1 + re-grants the survivors on-device, completes.
// Asserts the rotation genuinely happened on the live backend: epoch 0 → 1, a real chain-link at epoch 1, B
// re-granted at epoch 1, C gone, and the job cleared. The pure ex-member lockout crypto (E_0 can't derive E_1)
// is unit-tested in scopes.test.ts / epochs.test.ts; this proves the whole mechanism is wired live.
//
// The tenant domain is `veyq.localhost` — a valid dotted domain AND an RFC 6761 loopback name, so it serves as
// both the tenant domain and the fetch Host with no manual Host juggling. Run against a FRESH instance:
//   docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml down -v && up -d  → restart backend  →
//   VEYQ_E2E=1 npx vitest run scopeRotation.e2e
// Or let `python3 scripts/run_web_e2e.py` do all of that, which is what CI runs.
