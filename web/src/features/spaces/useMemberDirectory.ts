// Shared member-directory core for the tenant + group members panels (cr-0156, audit #74/P3d). Both panels

// and changed-key review wiring, and the load path (on the cr-0155 `useAsyncData` + `handle401` primitives with
// the `loadErrorKind` enum). This is that skeleton, once. Each panel keeps its own divergent halves (Tenant:
// invite-by-email + K_tenant name-decrypt; Group: add-by-username + role/rotation/rename/lifecycle) and passes a
// `loadBody` that fetches its rows + resolves ownership; the composable owns everything the two share.
