// A tiny cross-component signal that a space's icon changed (uc.spaces.set-space-icon). The owner edits the icon in
// the tenant members panel, but the always-mounted AppSidebar renders it (its own row + the switcher) — a different
// component that would otherwise keep a stale icon until a full reload. The panel bumps this after a set/clear; the
// sidebar watches it and re-decrypts. Carries no data — just a version tick — so it stays operator-blind by design.
