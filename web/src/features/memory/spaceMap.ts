// carries a `derived` position, unsealed **on device** under its own `K_mem`. Operator-blind by construction —
// there is no locations API; the pins come from the `wrappedMeta` that `listNodes` already returns (the loaded
// `treeStore`), so no coordinate ever crosses the blind server.
//
// Best-effort: a node whose key won't resolve or whose meta won't open is silently skipped (never a broken map).
// A **pending `auto`** location (armed at creation, no geotagged media yet) has no `derived` → no pin until its
// first upload materializes it. Folders carry no location and are never pinned.
