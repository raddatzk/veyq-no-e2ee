/**
 * The pure last-owner guards for scope-membership changes (ADR 0045 §2, ADR 0007), lifted out of [ScopesHandler] so
 * the "a scope may never be left ownerless" boundary is unit-tested and mutation-verified without a Quarkus boot.
 * The shell pre-resolves the caller-supplied facts — the target's `currentRole`, the requested `targetRole`, and the
 * scope's `ownerCount` — exactly as [com.veyq.app.features.admin.tenant.RemovalPolicy] pre-resolves its counts; the
 * `<= 1` boundary lives here, the queries stay in the shell.
 *
 * This is a *scope-membership* guard and is deliberately **not** folded into `RemovalPolicy` (that one is *tenant*
 * removal — a cascade in a different package). Same `<= 1` shape, distinct decision. Both predicates are true
 * exactly when the change would strand the scope without an OWNER, so the shell must reject it (ADR 0007).
