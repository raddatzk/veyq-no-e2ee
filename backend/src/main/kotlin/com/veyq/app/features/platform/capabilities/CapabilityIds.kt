 * The client-facing capability ids the backend pins from the append-only catalog
 * (`contracts/platform/capabilities.json`, ADR 0032). A capability is **instance-wide + pre-auth** ("this
 * server can do X at all") — not a per-scope/role permission. Each id is advertised on `GET /api/setup` (minus
 * the operator's disabled list) and enforced at its feature's create/enable gate (`422 capability_disabled`).
 * [CapabilityRegistryTest] asserts every id here is a real catalog entry — the same drift-proofing
 * [com.veyq.app.features.tasks.CapabilityTags] gets against its registry.
