 * selection, including the sole-owner `ownerCount <= 1` **orphan** trigger — are unit-tested and mutation-verified
 * without a Quarkus boot. The handler stays the imperative shell: it loads the membership directory, asks this
 * policy, and executes the returned steps (soft-delete / remove / transfer-then-remove); it decides nothing.
 *
 * Faithful to ADR 0014 §6 / ADR 0007 / ADR 0025:
 *  - the target's **own** scopes (PERSONAL + any solo GROUP) are grace-tombstoned; the shell keeps the membership,
 *    so they retain read-only access to read/export during the grace window (never rotated),
 *  - **shared** access is cut at once (layer-1) — the TENANT scope ACL-revoke only, a co-shared GROUP additionally
 *    queues a forward rotation (layer-2),
 *  - a GROUP the target **solely** owns hands ownership to the oldest remaining member first (the orphan rule — a
 *    server rule, the tenant owner never gains access); *who* that successor is stays a shell query.
