/**
 * The axis a rate limit counts on — the vocabulary of the declarative posture (ADR 0051).
 *
 * The split is not cosmetic: [IP] and [USER] are the only keys a **boundary filter** can know, because they come
 * from the request itself (remote address) or from the resolved `SecurityIdentity`. Every other key is a domain
 * value that only exists **behind** the handler's fine-grained authorization guard (the second layer in
 * `cc.security.authorization`), so those are *declaration markers* — the handler enforces them.
 *
 * An entry here is server-visible operational metadata by construction. **No key may ever be derived from
 * content** ([invariant] operator-blind) — that is a hard boundary on anything added to this enum.

/**
 * Declares that an endpoint (or every endpoint of a resource) is rate-limited on [key].
 *
 * The annotation carries the **key axis only, never the numbers** — limit values live in `VeyqConfig`
 * (`veyq.ratelimit.*`, `veyq.share.*.rate.*`) so a self-hosted instance can tune them ([invariant]
 * self-hostable), and so the limiter core can change without touching a single annotation.
 *
 * `@NameBinding` binds [IpRateLimitFilter] and [UserRateLimitFilter] to the annotated endpoints. **Name-binding
 * matches on the annotation TYPE, not its value** — so both filters are bound wherever *any* key is declared, and
 * each one reads the declared key at runtime ([RateLimitPosture]) and no-ops when it is not its own. A
 * handler-enforced key therefore passes through both filters untouched.
 *
 * A method-level annotation wins over a class-level one; a method-level [RateLimitExempt] overrides a class-level
 * `@RateLimit`.
