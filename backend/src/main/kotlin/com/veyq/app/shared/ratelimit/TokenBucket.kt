/**
 * The pure token-bucket arithmetic of every rate limit (ADR 0052), lifted out of the shell so the refill,
 * ceiling and `Retry-After` boundaries are unit-tested and mutation-verified without a Quarkus boot
 * (ADR 0045 §2). [TokenBucketCounter] stays the imperative shell: it reads the clock and drives the
 * `ConcurrentHashMap`; it asks these functions for every number it acts on.
 *
 * **Time is monotonic nanos**, passed in as a parameter — never read here. A wall-clock jump (NTP) therefore
 * cannot move a bucket, and negative elapsed time is clamped rather than trusted.
 *
 * **Tokens are integer milli-tokens** (thousandths), never a `Double`: float accumulation across millions of
 * calls drifts, and drift in a mutation-scoped class makes mutants survive for reasons unrelated to the
 * assertions. The trap that follows from integers, and the one most token-bucket implementations get wrong: on
 * refill, [refill] advances `lastRefillNanos` by **the nanos actually converted into tokens**, never to `now` —
 * setting it to `now` discards the sub-token remainder on every call and systematically under-refills under high
 * call rates. `TokenBucketTest.theSubTokenRemainderIsCarriedInsteadOfDiscardedOnEveryCall` fails any
 * implementation that does that.
 *
 * The bucket is **derived from the existing window config** and adds no key (ADR 0052): `capacity =
 * max-per-window` tokens, refilled at `max-per-window / window-seconds` tokens per second — so the sustained rate
 * and the burst size are exactly the ones an operator already tuned.
