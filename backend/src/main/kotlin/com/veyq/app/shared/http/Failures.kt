/**
 * Canonical [HttpFailure]s for semantic failures that recur across **more than one feature slice** — the single
 * source of truth for their `(code, status)` (ADR 0042). A failure variant in any slice delegates to one of these
 * with Kotlin interface delegation (`object … : SomeOutcome, HttpFailure by Failures.scopeNotFound`), so the
 * projection can never drift between the independent slices that raise it. Failures whose `code` is local to a
 * single slice (however often they recur *within* it) use the inline [httpFailure] factory at the variant instead
 * of an entry here — a global catalog is for cross-cutting failures, not one slice's private vocabulary.
