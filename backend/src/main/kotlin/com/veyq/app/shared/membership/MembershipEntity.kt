/**
 * Membership — the (user, scope, role, grant) relation (ADR 0007). A **shared, query-only primitive** (cr-0160):
 * it lives in `shared/membership/` because half a dozen feature slices read it, so it must not belong to any one
 * of them. It references a `scopeId` (cr-0026); the TENANT root scope is keyed `scopeId == tenantId`, a
 * PERSONAL/GROUP scope gets its own id. `wrappedGrant` is the scope key sealed to the member's identity public
 * key — opaque ciphertext the server stores but never opens. The first row is the owner's, born at tenant
 * activation (cr-0010); members extend the relation later via the invite-wrap, and each member births their own
 * PERSONAL scope (en.spaces.personal-scope).
