/**
 * Semantic status bucket → HTTP status code. The **one** place a failure's status number is decided, so no
 * `…Resource` re-derives it and two sites cannot disagree on the status of the same semantic failure (ADR 0042).
 *
 * `FORBIDDEN` (403) is only for a caller who legitimately knows the resource exists; a **membership-gated
 * absence** must be `NOT_FOUND` (404) so a non-member cannot distinguish "forbidden" from "not found" and thereby
 * learn a scope exists across the membership boundary.
 *
 * Which tag is correct is decided by **guard order**, not by the variant (ADR 0042, cr-0162): the membership
 * boundary is the *first* guard on every scope-addressed operation, so a `FORBIDDEN` raised after it — a
 * capability refusal like `not_key_holder` / `not_scope_owner` — discloses nothing, because that caller is a
 * member and already knows the scope exists. Tag a failure `FORBIDDEN` only if **no** path reaches it before the
 * membership guard; `OperatorBlindProbeTest` proves that for every endpoint.
