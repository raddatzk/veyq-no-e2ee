/**
 * Resolves an endpoint's declared rate-limit posture (ADR 0051) from its annotations.
 *
 * One resolver, two callers with very different jobs: the boundary filters ask *"is this mine to enforce?"* per
 * request, and the posture sweep asks *"did anyone declare anything at all?"* per endpoint. Both must agree on
 * precedence, which is why neither re-implements it — a filter that disagreed with the sweep would enforce a
 * posture the guard did not check, or the reverse.
 *
 * Precedence, method before class (mirroring how `@PermitAll` overrides a class-level `@Authenticated`):
 * a method-level [RateLimitExempt] or [RateLimit] wins outright; otherwise the class-level one applies.
