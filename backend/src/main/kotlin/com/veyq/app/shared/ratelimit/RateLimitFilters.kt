/**
 * The two **boundary-enforced** keys of the declarative rate-limit posture (ADR 0051): [RateLimitKey.IP] before
 * authentication and [RateLimitKey.USER] after it. Every other key in [RateLimitKey] is a marker the handler
 * enforces, and passes through both filters untouched.
 *
 * Both are bound by the `@RateLimit` `@NameBinding`, and **name-binding matches on the annotation TYPE, not its
 * value** — so each filter is invoked wherever *any* key is declared and must decide for itself. That decision is
 * the [RateLimitPosture.enforcedKey] read against [ResourceInfo]: not its key, not its request.

/**
 * Enforces `@RateLimit(key = IP)`: a best-effort, per-client-IP token bucket over the **public** surface —
 * defense-in-depth against brute-force, challenge-spam and cheap DoS. Ed25519 makes login forgery infeasible, so
 * the real value is bounding DoS, challenge-row churn, and the rate of any offline-grind enabling traffic.
 *
 * Runs at `AUTHENTICATION` priority, which is what makes it usable pre-auth — and also why `IP` is only valid on a
 * `@PermitAll` endpoint (a rule the posture sweep asserts statically): on an authenticated endpoint the principal
 * is both available and the better axis, and an IP bound there throttles a legitimate active user instead.
 *
 * **It trusts the client IP**: only correct behind a proxy when `quarkus.http.proxy.proxy-address-forwarding=true`
 * AND the proxy is trusted (else `X-Forwarded-For` is spoofable). We intentionally do NOT trust forwarded headers
 * by default. Tuning: `veyq.ratelimit.auth.max-requests` (default 60) per `veyq.ratelimit.auth.window-seconds`
 * (default 60) per client IP; set the max very high to effectively disable (the `%test` profile does this so the
 * slice tests, all from 127.0.0.1, don't trip it).
 *
 * **All `key = IP` endpoints share one bucket per IP.** That is a deliberate property, not an oversight: it bounds
 * an attacker's total public-surface spend rather than handing them a fresh budget per route. It is also why the
 * tenant-invite mint does *not* use this key — an authenticated owner would be counted against the same bucket as
 * anonymous login traffic, so its bound is the per-(tenant,recipient) [RateLimitKey.RECIPIENT] marker instead.

 * Runs **after** authorization, because there is nothing to key on before it: `quarkus.http.auth.proactive=false`
 * (ADR 0008, lazy authentication) means no identity is resolved at the `AUTHENTICATION` priority where

 * the filter **does nothing** — `key = USER` requires `@Authenticated` (asserted statically by the posture sweep),
