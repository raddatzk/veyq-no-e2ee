# UC: Buckets — group a Memory's media by who contributed it

- **ID:** uc.memory.buckets
- **Primary actor:** A member with an **unlocked vault** viewing a Memory who wants to see its media grouped by
  **who uploaded it** — their own contributions, a fellow member's, or a public contributor's.
- **Goal:** Organize a Memory's media in the **"Beiträge" tab** — group by uploader (the attribution axis, without
  disturbing the owner's Chapter curation) **and** file your own uploads into self-named **sub-buckets** (create /
  rename / delete folders, move media in — e.g. "Oma (WhatsApp)"). Ported from the pre-E2EE MemoryAssetBuckets
  organizer; always available (even an empty Memory), your primary bucket **virtual until** the first sub-bucket/upload.
- **Preconditions:** The vault is unlocked and the Memory is open (its **`K_mem`** is held); the bucket data layer
  ([en.memory.buckets](../enablers/en.memory.buckets.md)) is in place, so each medium carries an **`owner_key`**
  (a member `user:{userId}` **or** a contributor `share:{shareIdentityId}`) and a `bucket_id` (`null` = the
  owner's primary).
- **Postconditions (success):** A **"Beiträge"** view lists the Memory's uploaders (their **primary buckets**);
  selecting one filters the gallery grid to that uploader's media. **No data is mutated** in this slice — it is a
  read-side grouping over the bucket data layer.

## What buckets are here

A **bucket** = the media **one uploader** contributed to *this* Memory. It is the **attribution axis** ("who
contributed this?"), **orthogonal to Chapters** (the owner's curation axis) — an organization view over the same
media, **not** a node, permalink, or Memory / Chapter / Folder. The internal noun is **"bucket"** (a sanctioned
third noun, distinct from the Memory/Chapter product language); the **user-facing** surface is the **"Beiträge"
tab**.

The data model is a **real bucket table** keyed by an opaque **`owner_key`**
([en.memory.buckets](../enablers/en.memory.buckets.md), [ADR 0034](../../../decisions/0034-media-uploader-buckets.md)),
carrying a **lazy primary** bucket per uploader plus optional **one-level sub-buckets**. **This slice surfaces the
primary grouping**: each uploader's **primary bucket** (everything they contributed). The **sub-bucket management
UI** (create/rename/move/delete folders) is built next on the same table + endpoints.

Uploaders span **members** (`owner_key = user:{userId}`, display name = the per-tenant **username**) and anonymous
**public contributors** (`owner_key = share:{shareIdentityId}`, display name = the **`K_mem`-sealed** name from
[ADR 0030](../../../decisions/0030-contributor-public-share.md)). One's own bucket reads **"Deine Beiträge"**.

## Main flow

1. Open a Memory and switch to the **Beiträge** tab.
2. The client lists the Memory's buckets (or groups its already-loaded media by `owner_key` / `bucket_id`) and
   **unseals** the bucket names under `K_mem`.
3. It renders an **uploader picker** — **"Deine Beiträge"** first, then each fellow member / contributor with a
   **count**.
4. Selecting an uploader filters the existing **`MediaGrid`** to that uploader's **primary bucket**; opening an
   item uses the **same lightbox**. The owner's delete/trash and Chapter curation are untouched.
5. Nothing is written — this slice is a **read-side grouping**.

## Alternate / exception flows

- **Only your own contributions** → the picker shows just **"Deine Beiträge"**; a Memory nobody else touched can
  keep the tab quiet.
- **A sealed name won't unseal** (missing/rotated `K_mem`) → fall back to a neutral placeholder ("Beitrag"),
  **never block the grid**.
- **Group / tenant scope** → **member buckets only** (name = username). Anonymous contributor shares are
  **personal-scope-only** ([ADR 0029](../../../decisions/0029-public-viewer-share.md) / ADR 0030), so they do not
  appear in group/tenant memories.
- **A medium with `bucket_id = null`** (never attached to an explicit bucket, or a pre-column backfill) → it
  resolves to the **owner's primary bucket** (lazy), so it always groups under its uploader.

## Quality notes

- **Operator-blind.** The grouping reads the **opaque `owner_key`** + the bucket structure the operator already
  relays, and **unseals** the names **client-side** under `K_mem`. The operator learns **no cleartext name and no
  content**; a personal Memory with no share exposes only the account owner's `owner_key`.
- **A real data model.** The bucket table ([en.memory.buckets](../enablers/en.memory.buckets.md)) carries
  sub-buckets from day one, and the organizer UI (create/rename/delete a sub-bucket, move media in) is built on the
  shipped endpoints.
- **Reuse, not a new surface.** The organizer reuses the gallery **`MediaGrid` + lightbox**; the picker (a
  hierarchy Select), the dialogs, and the tile checkbox/menu are existing components — never invent UI.
- **Membership is server-enforced (cr-0123).** Create / rename / delete a sub-bucket + move media are gated to
  **scope membership** — **any member** may organize **any owner-root's** sub-buckets (yours *or* a
  contributor's), but **never a primary** and **never across owners** (a move stays within one owner-root);
  **delete media** + **edit capture time** stay any key-holder.

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** In a shared memory, see who added what: a "Contributions" view groups the photos and videos by the person
who uploaded them — you, a fellow member, or someone who added through a public link. It's just a lens over the
same memory; nothing is moved or changed, and everything stays encrypted — the grouping happens on your device, and
the server never learns anyone's name.

**DE —** In einer geteilten Erinnerung siehst du, wer was beigetragen hat: eine „Beiträge"-Ansicht gruppiert die
Fotos und Videos nach der Person, die sie hochgeladen hat — du selbst, ein anderes Mitglied oder jemand, der über
einen öffentlichen Link beigesteuert hat. Es ist nur eine Linse auf dieselbe Erinnerung; nichts wird verschoben
oder verändert, und alles bleibt verschlüsselt — die Gruppierung passiert auf deinem Gerät, und der Server erfährt
keinen Namen.
