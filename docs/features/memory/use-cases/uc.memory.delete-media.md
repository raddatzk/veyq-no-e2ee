# UC: Delete media — remove a photo into a recoverable per-Memory trash

- **ID:** uc.memory.delete-media
- **Primary actor:** A member with an **unlocked vault** viewing a Memory who wants to **remove** a photo/video.
- **Goal:** Take a media item out of a Memory — it **leaves the gallery immediately**, sits in that Memory's
  **recoverable trash** for a retention window, and is **hard-purged** (rows + blobs + store objects) by a
  scheduled system job afterwards. **Operator-blind** — the server flips a trash flag and, at purge, removes opaque
  blob objects; it never sees content.
- **Preconditions:** The vault is unlocked and the Memory is open (its **`K_mem`** is held); the caller **belongs to
  the scope**. The media data layer + blob store exist ([en.memory.media](../enablers/en.memory.media.md)); the
  live-updates reconcile is in place ([uc.memory.live-updates](uc.memory.live-updates.md), the `delete_revision`
  substrate).
- **Postconditions (success):** The media is gone from the gallery on **every open client**; it sits in the
  Memory's **Trash tab**, restorable, until the retention window elapses, then a scheduled job **irreversibly
  purges** it. The trashed record carries **who trashed it and when**.

## What deletion is here

Deletion is a **soft-delete → trash → retention window → scheduled hard-purge** flow (the
[security model](../../../crosscutting/security-model.md)'s own erasure mechanism). The two steps carry
**different authority**:

- **Trashing is reversible** — the media moves to the Memory's trash and is restorable for the window — so **any
  member of the scope** may do it (recovery, not destruction). It is **audited**: the trashed record carries
  `deleted_by` + `deleted_at`, so the action is accountable, not anonymous.
- **Purging is irreversible** — the blob-level hard-delete. It runs two ways: the scheduled retention job, and — for
  an item **already in the trash** — a member may **expedite** it by hand (cr-0111, from the Trash tab). A member
  cannot purge a **live** item directly; destruction always goes **trash → purge**.

For a **personal** scope "any member" is simply the owner; in a **shared** scope (group/tenant) any member may
trash **and** restore, and recoverability + the audit bound the blast radius. (Formal moderation — *who* may
delete *whose* — is deferred to a later groups/moderation refine.)

## Main flow

1. In the gallery **lightbox** (the only delete surface) the user removes the current photo — a **trash button** in
   the lightbox top bar, or the **Delete / Backspace** key. There is **no confirmation dialog** (it is recoverable):
   the media moves to the trash, the lightbox **advances to the next** photo (a fast culling flow), and an **undo
   toast** offers immediate restore.
2. The client calls **delete** → the server marks the media **trashed** (`deleted_at = now`,
   `deleted_by = the member`) and **bumps the node's `delete_revision`** ([uc.memory.live-updates](uc.memory.live-updates.md)),
   so every open gallery drops the tile on its next poll. Locally the tile is removed **optimistically** and the
   poll reconciles it.
3. Trashed media are **excluded from the normal media list** (`listNodeMedia` and its id-set), so they no longer
   appear in the gallery, **feed the `auto` date/place**, or serve as the **cover** (a trashed cover's `mediaId`
   dangles → the placeholder, the existing E2 fallback).
4. The Memory's **"Trash" tab** (beside *Gallery* / *Chapters*) lists trashed media in the **same justified grid**
   as the gallery (dimmed tiles). Each tile has a **checkbox** (batch-select) and a **3-dot menu** — **Restore**
   (clears `deleted_at`, bumps the revision, and the tile returns to the gallery in its date position) or
   **Delete forever** (the member-expedited purge, cr-0111; a confirm guards the irreversible hard-delete). A batch
   toolbar restores or purges the whole selection at once.
5. After the **retention window** (default **30 days**, operator-configurable), a **scheduled purge job**
   hard-deletes each expired trashed media — its derivative + media + blob rows and the store objects (reusing the
   blob-reclaim path). This step is **irreversible** and is **not** a member action.

## Alternate / exception flows

- **E1 — undo / restore:** the toast's *Restore*, or the Trash tab, clears the trash flag before purge; the media
  returns intact (its blobs were never removed — only the flag flipped).
- **E2 — the trashed media was the cover:** the `cover.mediaId` dangles → best-effort placeholder (the existing
  [uc.memory.cover](uc.memory.cover.md) E2 path); restoring brings the cover back. (Proactively clearing a cover
  that points at trashed media is an optional nicety, not required — the placeholder already prevents a broken
  tile.)
- **E3 — auto date/place:** `auto` ranges + the medoid **self-heal** from the shrunken media list on the next
  reload/poll ([uc.memory.date](uc.memory.date.md) / [uc.memory.place](uc.memory.place.md)) — no delete-specific
  reconcile code; a manual/`fixed` value is never touched.
- **E4 — not a member / vault locked:** the delete op is **scope-membership-gated**; a non-member gets a
  non-enumerable **404** (operator-blind), a locked vault cannot open the Memory to reach the affordance.
- **E5 — concurrent / idempotent:** trashing an already-trashed media is a no-op; restoring an already-**purged**
  media is a 404 (the retention job won the race).

## Quality notes

- **Operator-blind, unchanged.** Delete flips `deleted_at`/`deleted_by`; purge removes **opaque blob objects**.
  The **trash state** (a trashed flag + who + when) is coarse **operator-visible operational metadata**, exactly as
  listed in the [security model](../../../crosscutting/security-model.md) *(what is encrypted vs. server-visible)* —
  never content, never a key.
- **Reversible vs. irreversible (the security model's posture).** Any-member reversible trash + `deleted_by` audit;
  the irreversible purge is the scheduled **system job** — or, for an item **already in the trash**, a member
  expediting it by hand (cr-0111). A member never purges a **live** item in one step (destruction is trash → purge).
- **Reuses the live-updates substrate — no new propagation.** `bump delete_revision` + the id-set delete-reconcile
  ([ADR 0033](../../../decisions/0033-live-media-updates-revision-polling.md), cr-0107) drop the tile on every open
  gallery; the auto date/place self-heal from the shrunken list.
- **Reuses the blob-reclaim path.** The purge deletes derivative → media → blob rows in FK order and reclaims the
  store objects — the same logic the anonymous share *delete-own* (cr-0102) already runs, minus its identity
  predicate — so no new blob-lifecycle code, only its schedule.
- **Start light.** Soft-delete + retention **is** the security model's mechanism; a single **per-Memory trash tab**,
  no per-item "delete forever" UI, no cross-scope trash. The store isn't freed until the purge — an honest
  trade-off of recoverability, communicated by the retention window.
- **Web first, then native parity** ([ADR 0010](../../../decisions/0010-native-clients-shared-contracts-not-code.md)).

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** Remove a photo from a memory and it goes into that memory's trash — out of sight right away, but you can
put it back for 30 days if you change your mind. Only after that is it erased for good, automatically. In a shared
memory anyone can tidy up, and the trash shows who removed what — nothing vanishes without a trace. Everything
stays encrypted: the server only ever flips an "in the trash" marker and, later, deletes scrambled files it can't
read.

**DE —** Nimm ein Foto aus einer Erinnerung, und es wandert in deren Papierkorb — sofort aus dem Blick, aber
30 Tage lang zurückholbar, falls du es dir anders überlegst. Erst danach wird es automatisch endgültig gelöscht.
In einer geteilten Erinnerung kann jedes Mitglied aufräumen, und der Papierkorb zeigt, wer was entfernt hat —
nichts verschwindet spurlos. Alles bleibt verschlüsselt: der Server setzt nur eine „im Papierkorb"-Markierung und
löscht später verschlüsselte Dateien, die er nicht lesen kann.
