# UC: Memory cover — a chosen, cropped cover shown everywhere

- **ID:** uc.memory.cover
- **Primary actor:** A member with an **unlocked vault** who has a Memory open and wants to give it a **cover**.
- **Goal:** Curate a Memory's **cover** — pick **one image** and **crop** it — **sealed under the Memory's `K_mem`**
  and shown identically wherever the Memory appears: its **browse card**, its **detail header**, and its **map pin**
  ([uc.memory.place](uc.memory.place.md)). **Operator-blind** — the server never sees which image, or the crop.
- **Preconditions:** The vault is unlocked and the Memory is open (its **`K_mem`** is held). The node already carries
  the sealed `wrappedMeta` blob ([en.memory.node-meta](../enablers/en.memory.node-meta.md)); this adds a `cover`
  sub-object beside the `date`/`location`.
- **Postconditions (success):** The Memory shows its chosen cover everywhere it appears — browse card, detail
  header, map pin; the user can re-crop, change, or remove it. The server stored only the **opaque `wrappedMeta`** blob + the unchanged node shape.

## What a cover is

A cover is **one image plus a crop**, deliberately chosen — **there is no auto-cover** (a cover never appears from
nothing; unset ⇒ a placeholder shows, like a location is never auto-created). The image source is:

- **an existing Memory media** — referenced by `mediaId` (this use-case's first slice, cr-0072); or
- **a brand-new uploaded image** that is **not** added to the Memory's media — a **standalone cover blob** committed
  to the node with **no `veyq_media` row** (so it never appears in the gallery), sealed under a `K_blob` wrapped by
  `K_mem` and served over the existing presigned transport (cr-0073).

The **crop is normalized `{ x, y, width, height }` in 0..1** against the source image (the pre-E2EE design source's
`CoverCrop`), so **one stored crop renders identically at any size** — a small card, a larger detail header, or a
map pin — with no per-surface crop and no cropped-image upload. The whole `cover { source, crop }` is sealed in the
node's `wrappedMeta` under `K_mem`; the display just expands the decrypted thumbnail inside an `overflow:hidden` box
and offsets it.

## Main flow

1. The cover image comes from one of two entry points — **there is no modal media picker** (browsing existing
   photos stays in the gallery, which scales to any count):
   - **A Memory photo — framed in the cropper:** open a photo in the **gallery lightbox** and choose
     **"Set as cover"**. This opens the **crop editor seeded on that photo** (its already-decrypted thumbnail is
     the crop source — the exact tier the cover renders from), with the **lightbox staying open underneath** (its
     keyboard suspended) so the user keeps browsing after saving. The user frames the 16:9 crop and saves; if the
     photo is **already the cover**, its stored crop is pre-loaded to fine-tune. The button marks the current cover.
   - **A brand-new image, or re-cropping the current cover:** the header's **"set cover"** opens the editor —
     **"Upload a photo"** (an `<input type=file accept=image/*>`), or the current cover pre-loaded to re-frame.
2. In the editor a **16:9 crop viewport** (filling the dialog width) shows the source — a **Memory photo picked in
   the lightbox**, an **uploaded image**, or the **current cover re-framed**; the user **drag-pans** and **zooms**
   (1–3×) to frame it. Save normalizes the pan/zoom back to the `0..1` crop rectangle.
3. On save, the client seals `cover { source, crop }` — `source` = the media `mediaId` or the uploaded blob ref —
   into the node's `wrappedMeta` under `K_mem` (read-modify-write — the sibling date/location are preserved) and
   PATCHes it via `updateNode`. Switching away from an uploaded cover reclaims its standalone blob. The detail
   header re-renders; the browse card and the map pin pick it up.
4. **Everywhere the Memory shows**, its cover is rendered from the same sealed crop over the chosen media's
   decrypted thumbnail: the **browse card**, the **detail header**, the **map pin**. **Remove** clears the cover →
   the placeholder returns in all three.

## Alternate / exception flows

- **E1 — no cover set:** all three places show the **placeholder** (the soft-accent images tile). Deliberate —
  no auto-pick.
- **E2 — the chosen media was deleted:** the `cover.mediaId` dangles → best-effort fall back to the placeholder
  (never a broken card/pin); the user can pick a new cover.
- **E3 — vault locked / Memory not open:** without the node's `K_mem` the `wrappedMeta` can't be unsealed → the
  cover is unavailable until unlock + open.
- **E4 — malformed / wrong-key `wrappedMeta` or crop:** best-effort — a bad crop normalizes to the full frame; an
  unopenable blob shows the placeholder. Never a throw.

## Quality notes

- **Operator-blind.** The server holds the node shape + the **opaque `wrappedMeta`**; never the chosen image id or
  the crop. The cover is sealed under `K_mem` and unsealed only on device. (Envelope + node-level blindness:
  [en.memory.node-meta](../enablers/en.memory.node-meta.md).)
- **One normalized crop, one image, everywhere.** A single `0..1` crop drives the card, the detail header, and the
  map pin through one shared display formula — a Memory reads as itself wherever it appears, with no re-cropping
  and no extra blob for the existing-media case.
- **No auto-cover (deliberate).** A cover is a curation choice, mirroring the location: it is set on purpose, and
  its absence is an honest placeholder rather than a guessed photo. (This retires the cr-0071 stopgap where the map
  pin auto-picked the media nearest the place.)
- **Reuse the existing UI/UX — never invent.** The picker + hand-rolled pan/zoom crop + the crop-display formula
  are existing components (`MemoryCoverDialog` / `MemoryCoverImage` / `CoverCrop`);
  only the data layer is swapped to the contracts client + `K_mem` sealing. No crop library is added.

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** Give a memory a **face**. Pick one of its photos, crop it how you like, and that cover shows up everywhere
the memory appears — its card, its page, and its pin on the map. Which photo you chose and how you framed it are
locked with the memory's own key on your device; the server only ever stores scrambled data.

**DE —** Gib einer Erinnerung ein **Gesicht**. Wähle eines ihrer Fotos, schneide es zu, wie du magst — und dieses
Cover erscheint überall, wo die Erinnerung auftaucht: auf ihrer Karte, ihrer Seite und ihrem Pin auf der Landkarte.
Welches Foto du gewählt und wie du es zugeschnitten hast, wird mit dem eigenen Schlüssel der Erinnerung auf deinem
Gerät verschlüsselt; der Server speichert nur verschlüsselte Daten.

  contract + backend + web, cr-0073). cr-0073 generalized the cr-0072 **`mediaId`-only** `cover` shape into a
  discriminated **`source` (media | upload blob ref)** — with a backward-compatible `normalizeMemoryCover` so
  existing `{ mediaId, crop }` seals still open — and branched `loadNodeCover` onto a blob-fetch path; the display
  (`MemoryCoverImage` + `coverImageStyle`) and the crop editor are reused unchanged. cr-0109 changed the lightbox
  **"Set as cover"** from a one-click full-frame set into **opening the crop editor seeded on that photo** (the
  lightbox stays open beneath the modal, its keyboard suspended) so the 16:9 crop is framed at pick time — the
  editor gained a third `media` crop source alongside `upload`/`keep`.
