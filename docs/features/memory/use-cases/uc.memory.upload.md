# UC: Upload media into a Memory (web)

- **ID:** uc.memory.upload
- **Primary actor:** Account holder browsing a Memory on the **web** client.
- **Goal:** Add photos/videos to the open Memory — sealed on-device and uploaded direct-to-store — with a
  **global uploads tray** (a TopBar button + popup) that shows every in-flight upload's progress and lets the
  user cancel, while they keep navigating.
- **Preconditions:** Signed in + unlocked; a Memory is open (its `K_mem` is available); the media data layer +
  blob store exist (en.memory.media, cr-0028/0029) and derivatives are generated on-device (cr-0045).
- **Postconditions (success):** Each picked file is sealed under a fresh `K_blob` (wrapped to `K_mem`), its
  chunks `PUT` straight to the store, and one logical media (original + role-tagged derivatives) is attached to
  the Memory node. The gallery refreshes to show it. Operator-blind throughout — the server sees only ciphertext
  + opaque sizes/counts.

## Main flow

1. In the open Memory's gallery the user picks files (a hidden `<input type=file multiple accept=image/*,video/*>`
   behind an **Upload** affordance).
2. Each file is enqueued into the **global upload queue** as a batch against the current `{scopeId, nodeId}` +
   the Memory key. The TopBar **uploads** button shows a spinner + an active-file count badge, **and** the picked
   photos appear **immediately as tiles in that Memory's gallery grid** — an instant **local preview** (the user's
   own image, before it is sealed — a local object URL, never uploaded in the clear) with a per-tile progress /
   error(+retry) state (cr-0074).
3. The queue uploads **one file at a time**: each file is sealed on-device (with its
   [derivatives](../enablers/en.memory.derivatives.md)) and sent **direct-to-store**, then attached to the
   Memory node — the seal → start → PUT → attach choreography is
   [en.memory.media](../enablers/en.memory.media.md)'s. Per-file + per-batch **progress** advance as it uploads.
4. Opening the uploads popup shows each batch's files with status (queued / uploading / done / failed /
   cancelled), a progress bar, and a **cancel** control while a file is queued/uploading.
5. As each file finishes, its optimistic tile **reconciles into the real decrypted thumbnail** (matched by the
   returned `mediaId`) with no empty-flash and no duplicate; the tile sorts into its date position. The user can
   **close** (acknowledge) the finished batch in the tray.

## Alternate / exception flows

- **E1 — transient failure** (aborted/failed request): the file is re-queued for one automatic retry; a
  hard error marks it **failed** and cancels the rest of that batch's queued files (the user retries explicitly).
- **E2 — cancel:** cancelling a queued file drops it; cancelling an in-flight file aborts its PUTs and stops
  before `complete` (no media is attached). The abandoned upload session is reclaimed by the store-side GC.
- **E3 — Safari's Photos picker.** Files chosen from the Photos gallery arrive with an **empty MIME type**, and
  Safari **populates `input.files` late / across repeated picks**. The picker therefore (a) accepts a
  file by **extension** when its `type` is empty, (b) **re-reads** the input over a short retry window and
  **merges** (never replaces) by a `name:size:lastModified:type` signature, and (c) infers a `mediaType` from
  the extension so derivation can still run (HEIC/MOV). Underivable bytes upload **original-only** (the gallery
  shows an icon).
- **E4 — underivable media:** if on-device derivation fails (codec the browser can't decode), the original is
  uploaded without derivatives rather than failing the upload.

## Quality notes

- **Operator-blind, unchanged.** The client seals every chunk under a random `K_blob` (wrapped to `K_mem`) and
  PUTs raw sealed bytes; the server stores ciphertext + opaque sizes/counts (ADR 0013). No plaintext, key, or
  filename reaches the server in the clear.
- **The tray is global + non-blocking.** Uploads continue while the user browses other Memories; the queue is a
  module singleton, the popup lives in the app shell.
- **Sequential, not parallel.** One file at a time keeps the byte-budget + open-session accounting simple.

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** Drop photos or videos into a memory and they upload in the background — a button up top shows how each
one is going, and you can cancel any of them. Everything is scrambled on your device before it leaves; the
server only ever stores the scrambled pieces.

**DE —** Leg Fotos oder Videos in eine Erinnerung — sie laden im Hintergrund hoch; ein Button oben zeigt den
Fortschritt jedes Uploads, und du kannst jeden abbrechen. Alles wird auf deinem Gerät verschlüsselt, bevor es es
verlässt; der Server speichert nur die verschlüsselten Teile.
