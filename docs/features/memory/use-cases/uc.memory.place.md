# UC: Memory place — one sealed, named location

- **ID:** uc.memory.place
- **Primary actor:** A member with an **unlocked vault** who has a Memory (or chapter) open and wants to give it
  a **place**.
- **Goal:** Curate a Memory's **place** — **one named location**: a map position derived from the Memory's own
  photo GPS, plus a name that is either typed or reverse-geocoded — **sealed under the Memory's `K_mem`** and
  shown on the Memory's detail header and a later **tenant-wide map** — **operator-blind** (the veyq server never
  sees a coordinate or a place name).
- **Preconditions:** The vault is unlocked and the Memory is open (its **`K_mem`** is held). The node's
  `wrappedMeta` blob already exists (shipped for the date, [uc.memory.date](uc.memory.date.md)); place adds a
  `location` sub-object to it.
- **Postconditions (success):** Once set, the Memory shows its named location; the user can "set location" (a
  medoid position + a typed or reverse-geocoded name), move/rename it, and see it as a pin on the tenant map. The
  server stored only the **opaque `wrappedMeta` blob** + the unchanged node shape.

A Memory carries **one location** — a map position (from its own photo GPS) plus a **name** (typed or
reverse-geocoded). Name and coordinate are **independent**, and setup is **deliberate** (never silent). The
sealed **shape** + how it is materialized live in the enabler
[en.memory.node-meta](../enablers/en.memory.node-meta.md); the reverse-only, veyq-blind **geocoding** decision
is [ADR 0016](../../../decisions/0016-geocoding-provider-neutrality.md). This use-case is the **user flow**.

## Main flow — set a location on a Memory that has media

1. With the Memory open, the user triggers **"set location"**.
2. The client forms `derived` as the **medoid** of the Memory's media GPS, read from the **always-listed capture
   tier** (it carries each medium's GPS alongside its `capturedAt`, so this costs no per-item fetch).
3. The client asks for a **name**, one of two ways:
   - **typed** → `manual` (e.g. "at grandma's"); or
   - **framed on the map**, if the reverse lookup is enabled → its centre + zoom become the `nameAnchor`, the
     provider returns a name at that resolution → `geocoded`, still editable.
4. On save the client seals `{ v, …, location }` under `K_mem` and PATCHes `wrappedMeta`. The Memory's detail
   header shows the named location, and it appears as a pin on the tenant map.

## Alternate / exception flows

- **A1 — pre-arm at creation (no media yet):** as with the date, the user may declare a location while creating
  the Memory: a **fallback name** (mandatory) + `nameSource` (`manual` = final, or `geocoded` = a placeholder to
  be resolved), with `derivedMode: 'auto'` forced (there is nothing to snapshot). Then **on the first geotagged
  medium** `derived` forms as the medoid, and — only if the user opted into geocoding — `nameAnchor` forms at a
  default zoom and the name resolves, replacing the fallback. No opt-in ⇒ the fallback simply stands (blind).
- **A2 — the position keeps itself current, until the user overrides:** position is **`auto` by default** and
  re-medoids as media are added (it barely moves). **Moving the pin by hand flips it to `fixed`** — the
  deliberate correction wins and then stays frozen, exactly as a manual date beats `auto`. A `manual` name and a
  `fixed` position are frozen; a `geocoded` name may refresh when its anchor moves.
- **A3 — browse the map:** a **toggle in the tenant root** shows every Memory as a pin, read from each node's
  sealed `location` via `listNodes` — no media load, no locations endpoint. Clicking a pin opens the Memory.

- **E1 — vault locked / Memory not open:** without the node's `K_mem` the `wrappedMeta` can't be unsealed → the
  place is unavailable until unlock + open.
- **E2 — malformed / wrong-key `wrappedMeta`:** best-effort — treated as no location; never a broken header/pin.
- **E3 — "set location" with no photo GPS:** `derived` can't be formed. The user still types a **name**
  (`manual`) → a valid **name-only** location: shown in the detail, but **not** on the map (no coordinate).
- **E4 — reverse-lookup off or unreachable:** the name field falls back to **manual typing** — no external
  request, fully blind. The map/pin still works from `derived`; only the auto-name is unavailable.
- **E5 — a member who declined geocoding opens a shared Memory:** they **see** the stored (sealed) name that
  another member resolved, with **no request from their device** — the opt-in is per-device-request, not
  per-view.
- **E6 — invalid manual range / bad input:** the editor validates before sealing (e.g. a name is required to
  save a location).

## Quality notes

- **Sharing (groups/tenant) — consent is per space, not a free-ride.** Tiles + geocoding are **one opt-in**
  consented **per space** ([ADR 0016](../../../decisions/0016-geocoding-provider-neutrality.md)): a user
  pre-opts-in in personal settings (then a join is just an info pill) or opts in per space. An owner enabling it
  **notifies** members and does **not** bind them — a **non-consenting** member's device makes no request, so
  they get **no map** and see an already-resolved name only as **text**; they give up the map to keep their
  privacy (not a free-ride). **Unanimity binds:** once all members consent it is binding for new members (a
  ratchet — to withdraw you leave the space, you don't stay as a text-only rider). A resolved name is sealed in
  the shared `wrappedMeta`, so members holding `K_mem` see it without their own device contacting the provider.
- **Multilingual names.** A stored `name` is a **single frozen string**. For **shared** content it resolves in
  the **tenant's configured language** (a tenant setting) — consistent across members, not the random locale of
  whoever resolved it first; a personal space uses the user's own locale. Because `nameAnchor` is kept, an
  opted-in viewer can re-resolve in **their** language on demand. Nominatim returns names from OSM `name:<lang>`
  tags via `accept-language` with **graceful fallback to the local name** (no hard error on an unsupported
  language) — so de+en are well covered and further locales degrade, never break.
- **Operator-blind — the *veyq* operator is the adversary.** The veyq server sees the node shape + coarse
  timestamps + the **opaque `wrappedMeta`** blob; never a place name or a coordinate. The **opt-in
  reverse-geocoding request is a different, consented trust boundary**: it goes **client-direct** to the provider
  (never through the veyq backend — proxying would let the operator see the coordinate), carries **no veyq
  identity** (a bare coordinate), and is transparent. The threat-model clarification + this third-party boundary
  live in [security-model](../../../crosscutting/security-model.md); the provider seam in
  [ADR 0016](../../../decisions/0016-geocoding-provider-neutrality.md).
- **Place is deliberately set up, then may auto-fill; the medoid keeps it honest.** A location never *appears
  from nothing* — the user deliberately sets one up (at open or at creation) with a mandatory name. From there it
  may auto-fill: the position is the **medoid** of the media GPS (an actual photo spot, never the sea, barely
  moving as media are added — this is what makes `derivedMode: 'auto'` safe), and, **only under the user's opt-in**,
  the `geocoded` name auto-resolves on the first geotagged media (standing consent — see the reverse-lookup note).
- **GPS rides the listed capture tier — like the date.** The medoid (and every `auto` re-medoid on media-add)
  reads GPS **list-level**, the way date-`auto` reads `capturedAt` — GPS is promoted into the always-listed
  capture tier rather than left in the per-item EXIF blob. The lazy alternative (fetch each media's sealed EXIF
  on demand) was rejected: it would make `derivedMode: 'auto'` re-medoid an N-fetch operation on every upload.
  Still sealed under `K_mem`, still operator-blind; no backfill — older media without the listed tier don't
  contribute to the medoid (exactly as they don't to date-`auto`).

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** Give a memory a **where**. You pick "set location": your photos' own GPS drop a pin at a real spot you
visited, and you give it a name — type one ("at grandma's"), or, if you switch it on, let a map service turn the
pin into a name ("Tenerife"). Later, a map shows all your memories as pins. It's all locked with the memory's own
key on your device, so **veyq's server** never learns the place or the coordinates. The only thing that ever
leaves your device is — if *you* turn it on — a bare coordinate sent straight to the map service to fetch a name;
veyq never sees it.

**DE —** Gib einer Erinnerung ein **Wo**. Du wählst „Ort festlegen": das GPS deiner Fotos setzt einen Pin an einen
echten Ort, an dem du warst, und du gibst ihm einen Namen — tippst ihn selbst („bei Oma") oder lässt, wenn du es
einschaltest, einen Kartendienst aus dem Pin einen Namen machen („Teneriffa"). Später zeigt eine Karte alle deine
Erinnerungen als Pins. Alles wird mit dem eigenen Schlüssel der Erinnerung auf deinem Gerät verschlüsselt;
**veyqs Server** erfährt weder den Ort noch die Koordinaten. Das Einzige, was je dein Gerät verlässt, ist —
*wenn du es einschaltest* — eine nackte Koordinate, direkt an den Kartendienst geschickt, um einen Namen zu holen;
veyq sieht sie nie.
