# UC: Manage a group's members (promote / demote / remove)

- **ID:** uc.spaces.manage-group-members
- **Primary actor:** **GroupOwner** (`OWNER` on the GROUP scope). Removal's key rotation is completed by **any
  remaining key-holder's device** (operator-blind — the server cannot).
- **Goal:** run a group's roster — **promote** a member to co-owner, **demote** a co-owner back to member, and
  **remove** a member — within the ownership rules, so a removed member loses access to **new** content.
- **Preconditions:** The caller is an **OWNER** of the group ([ADR 0014](../../../decisions/0014-group-scopes-and-governance.md) §4).
  The target is a current member of the group.
- **Postconditions (success):** The target's role/membership reflects the action. On **removal**, the membership is
  deleted (instant 403) **and** the scope rotates its content key forward so the removed member can't read
  post-removal content ([en.spaces.scope-key-rotation](../enablers/en.spaces.scope-key-rotation.md)). The server
  saw only role/membership metadata + opaque epoch links/grants — never a key.

## Main flow

1. In the group's **members** view ([uc.spaces.add-group-member](uc.spaces.add-group-member.md) directory), the
   GroupOwner picks a member and an action.
2. **Promote → co-owner:** the member's role becomes `OWNER`. Pure role change — no key move (they already hold
   `K_SC`). Groups have only OWNER / MEMBER; **multiple owners allowed** ([ADR 0007](../../../decisions/0007-membership-role-grant-relation.md)).
3. **Demote co-owner → member:** the OWNER's role becomes `MEMBER`. Blocked by the **last-owner guard** (below).
4. **Remove a member:**
   - The server **deletes** their membership — instant **layer-1** access cut (a 403 on the scope). Blocked by the
     last-owner guard for the last OWNER.
   - The group **rotates forward** ([en.spaces.scope-key-rotation](../enablers/en.spaces.scope-key-rotation.md)): a
     remaining owner's device mints a new content-epoch, re-grants it to the remaining members (grant-delivery,
     first-online-wins), and new content seals under it. The removed member keeps the old epoch → reads
     pre-removal content, **never** post-removal content, even against a malicious operator ([ADR 0024](../../../decisions/0024-scope-key-rotation.md)).

## Alternate / exception flows

- **A1 — last-owner guard.** The **last remaining OWNER** cannot be demoted or removed (a group needs ≥1 owner,
  [ADR 0007](../../../decisions/0007-membership-role-grant-relation.md) / [ADR 0014](../../../decisions/0014-group-scopes-and-governance.md) §4).
  The action is rejected; the caller must first promote another member or delete the group.
- **A2 — no key-holder online to rotate.** Removal's layer-1 (deleted membership → 403) is immediate; the crypto
  rotation is *queued* as a `SCOPE_ROTATION` job on the operator-blind task queue until a remaining key-holder is
  next online, who mints `E_{n+1}` + re-grants the survivors on-device and completes it (the **async rotation
  backstop**, cr-0092; the same mechanism serves [uc.spaces.remove-tenant-member](uc.spaces.remove-tenant-member.md)
  A4). Idempotent + first-online-wins ([en.spaces.scope-key-rotation](../enablers/en.spaces.scope-key-rotation.md) §E1).
  Not a hole.
- **A3 — a non-owner attempts an action:** rejected (owner-gated, enforced by code, [ADR 0008](../../../decisions/0008-centralized-http-auth.md)).
- **E1 — already-read content:** a removed member keeps whatever they already decrypted — **not retractable** by
  any design (the stated limit). Removal protects **future** content only.

> **Sibling — group lifecycle (G3b):** deleting a group (soft-delete + 30-day grace + restore, then a scheduled
> hard-purge) is [uc.spaces.delete-group](uc.spaces.delete-group.md). The **orphan rule** (when a sole owner leaves
> the tenant, ownership auto-transfers to the **oldest remaining member**, else grace-tombstone,
> [ADR 0014](../../../decisions/0014-group-scopes-and-governance.md) §6) rides with **tenant** member-removal
> ([ADR 0025](../../../decisions/0025-forward-secrecy-policy-per-scope.md)), which is future work.

## Quality notes

- **Operator-blind.** Role changes + membership deletion are operational metadata the server already holds; the
  rotation stores only opaque epoch links + grants + a per-node epoch index — never a key or a name.
- **Admission stays owner-gated; delivery is any key-holder.** Only an OWNER may change roles or remove; the
  removal's re-grant to remaining members is completed by any online key-holder (first-online-wins), matching the
  add-member split ([ADR 0020](../../../decisions/0020-grant-distribution-invite-wrap.md)).
- **Roles are per-scope.** A group OWNER/MEMBER is independent of any tenant role — a GroupOwner need not be the
  tenant owner, and the tenant owner has no say over group roles ([ADR 0014](../../../decisions/0014-group-scopes-and-governance.md) §4).

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** Your group's roster is yours to run: make a trusted member a co-owner so you're not the only one who can
manage it, step someone back down, or remove someone who no longer belongs. When you remove someone, two things
happen at once — they immediately lose access, and the group quietly re-keys so that **everything you add from
then on is sealed away from them**, even if the server itself were turned against you. What they already saw, they
saw — no app can reach into their memory — but nothing new. A group always keeps at least one owner, so it can
never be left with no one in charge.

**DE —** Die Mitgliederliste deiner Gruppe gehört dir: mach ein vertrautes Mitglied zum Mit-Owner, damit nicht nur
du verwalten kannst, stufe jemanden wieder herab, oder entferne jemanden, der nicht mehr dazugehört. Beim Entfernen
passieren zwei Dinge gleichzeitig — die Person verliert sofort den Zugang, und die Gruppe wechselt still den
Schlüssel, sodass **alles, was du ab dann hinzufügst, für sie versiegelt bleibt** — selbst wenn der Server gegen
dich gerichtet würde. Was sie schon gesehen hat, hat sie gesehen — das holt keine App zurück — aber nichts Neues.
Eine Gruppe behält immer mindestens eine:n Owner, kann also nie führungslos zurückbleiben.
