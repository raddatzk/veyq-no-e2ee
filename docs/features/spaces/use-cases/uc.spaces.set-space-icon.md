# UC: Space icon — a chosen image as a space's avatar

- **ID:** uc.spaces.set-space-icon
- **Primary actor:** the space's **OWNER** — the **TenantOwner** (`OWNER` on the tenant **root** scope,
  `scopeId == tenantId`) on a TENANT, the **GroupOwner** (incl. a promoted co-owner) on a GROUP. The owner is the space's
  **icon authority**, exactly as they are its name authority ([uc.spaces.rename-group](uc.spaces.rename-group.md)).
- **Secondary actor:** every other member — they **read** the icon; they never write it.
- **Goal:** give a space a **face** — one square image, framed on device and **sealed** so the server never
  sees it — shown wherever the space appears: the sidebar's active row and the tenant overview
  ([uc.spaces.switch-spaces](uc.spaces.switch-spaces.md)). The **initial** stays the fallback.
- **Preconditions:** an **authenticated, unlocked** `OWNER` who holds a grant at the scope's **current**
  content-key epoch (the write key). The scope is a **TENANT** or a **GROUP** — a
  **PERSONAL** scope has no icon, there being nothing to tell it apart from. It is **active**, not
  pending-deletion ([uc.spaces.delete-group](uc.spaces.delete-group.md) A4).
- **Postconditions (success):** the scope row carries `sealedIcon` — one **constant-length** ciphertext,
  whatever the source image was — and `iconEpoch` = the epoch it was sealed under. Every member holding a
  grant sees the icon on their next list; the server stored an opaque blob of a fixed size + a small integer,
  and never the image, its size, or a key.

## What a space icon is

A space icon is **one square image, deliberately chosen** — there is **no auto-icon**. A space never gets a
face from nothing; unset ⇒ the initial shows, mirroring a Memory without a cover
([uc.memory.cover](../../memory/use-cases/uc.memory.cover.md)).

Unlike a Memory cover — which stores a **reference + a normalized `0..1` crop** and re-renders it from the
referenced media — an icon stores its **own pixels**: there is no source image on the server to re-frame
against, so **the crop is baked in at save**. The consequence is stated, not hidden: an icon cannot be
re-framed later, and replacing one means picking a new file. For an avatar rendered at ~38 px that is the
right trade, and it is what keeps the icon a **field** — no `K_blob`, no blob path, no chunking; like a name,
one row, one write.

Two properties make that field safe to keep inline:

- **A fixed pixel box.** The image is re-encoded on device to a fixed square. The avatar renders at
  2.1–2.35 rem ≈ 34–38 CSS px, so **256×256** carries roughly 2× headroom for any future surface.
- **A constant plaintext length.** The encoded bytes are **padded to a constant** before sealing, so every
  `sealedIcon` in the database has the identical length — a flat two-colour logo and a dense family photo are
  indistinguishable by size. This also turns the column's size cap into an exact computed constant rather than
  an estimate (see the Quality notes).

## Main flow

1. **The owner picks an image.** In the space's settings they choose a file (`accept="image/*"`). There is no
   picker over existing media — an icon is not curated out of a Memory's photos.
2. **They frame it 1:1.** A square crop viewport with drag-pan + zoom. This is the Memory cover's cropper —
   which today is **inline in `MemoryCoverDialog.vue` and hardcoded to 16:9**, so serving an avatar means
   **extracting** it and giving it a ratio. Saving **bakes** the framing into the pixels.
3. **The client re-encodes + pads.** The framed square goes through the existing on-device pixel stage
   (`deriveImage`, called with its own spec — the seam `uploadCoverBlob` already uses) to the fixed 256×256
   box, then the encoded bytes are padded to the constant plaintext length. Quality steps down until the
   encode fits the pad target.
4. **The client seals it under the current epoch.** `e = currentEpoch` (the write key, peeled from the grant);
   `K_icon_e = hkdfSha256(E_e, salt = "", info = "veyq/v1/space-icon-key", 32)`;
   `sealedIcon = b64std(symWrap(K_icon_e, paddedIcon, "space-icon", randomBytes(12)))` — the `sealName` shape
   over the repo's one symmetric seal (`0x02 || nonce(12) || aead`), with `space-icon` as the AAD context.
   Sealing under the **current** epoch is what makes a replaced icon forward-secret — the same reason a rename
   does it. (Note the sibling docs write this step as `symEncrypt(…)`; that is notation, not a symbol — the
   primitive is `symWrap`.)
5. **POST the icon.** `POST /api/scopes/{scopeId}/icon { sealedIcon, iconEpoch: e }` — two opaque values.
6. **The server writes the row (blind).** Owner-gated on the **scope row** (A3); it rejects a stale
   `iconEpoch` (A1) and a pending-deletion scope (A2). Otherwise it overwrites `sealed_icon` + `icon_epoch`
   and returns `204`. It never derives a key, decodes an image, or learns its size.
7. **Members read it.** On their next list a member takes `iconEpoch`, peels the epoch chain to
   `E_iconEpoch`, derives `K_icon_e`, decrypts + unpads, and renders it through `TenantAvatar`'s existing
   `icon` prop over an object URL owned by `useObjectUrls`. In the **tenant overview** that same read runs
   once per tenant against that tenant's own grant — the widened read path
   [uc.spaces.switch-spaces](uc.spaces.switch-spaces.md) shows and
   [en.spaces.tenant-scope](../enablers/en.spaces.tenant-scope.md) specifies.

## Alternate / exception flows

- **A1 — stale epoch (a concurrent rotation):** between the owner's read and their POST another owner removed
  a member and rotated, so `currentEpoch` advanced → `409 stale_epoch`. The client refetches, re-seals under
  the fresh epoch and retries **once** — the same optimistic-concurrency shape, and the same client retry, a
  rename already uses ([uc.spaces.rename-group](uc.spaces.rename-group.md) A1). Rare on a group; on a tenant
  it effectively cannot happen (see the `iconEpoch` note below).
- **A2 — the space is pending-deletion:** an icon-set is a content write → `409`, read-only until
  restore/purge ([uc.spaces.delete-group](uc.spaces.delete-group.md) A4). Group slice only — a tenant has no
  grace-delete.
- **A3 — the caller is not the OWNER:** `403 not_scope_owner`. A plain member is not the icon authority. The
  membership guard runs **first**, so a non-member gets the same `404` as a bogus id
  ([ADR 0042](../../../decisions/0042-http-failure-projection.md)).
- **A4 — the reader holds no grant for that space:** the icon cannot be opened → the **initial** shows. Not an
  error. This is the **awaiting-access** window: a member admitted to a tenant is grant-less until a key-holder
  comes online and grant-delivery wraps `K_SC` to them ([uc.spaces.add-member](uc.spaces.add-member.md),
  [ADR 0020](../../../decisions/0020-grant-distribution-invite-wrap.md)) — so it is **transient**, not the
  steady state.
- **A5 — remove the icon:** the owner clears it → `sealed_icon` + `icon_epoch` are reset and every member falls
  back to the initial. Same owner gate, but **no epoch check**: a removal carries no ciphertext that could be
  sealed under a stale epoch, so the concurrency guard a set needs (A1) has nothing to guard here. Idempotent.
- **E1 — the browser cannot decode the file:** rejected in the picker with a message. Unlike a Memory cover —
  which seals the **pristine bytes** un-resized when a codec is undecodable — an icon has **no such fallback**:
  the fixed box and the constant length are the whole point, so bytes that cannot be re-encoded cannot be
  stored. Size, though, is never the user's problem — any decodable image is re-encoded to fit.
- **E2 — malformed / wrong-key `sealedIcon`:** best-effort — the initial shows. Never a throw and never a
  broken image, the same posture a dangling Memory cover takes
  ([uc.memory.cover](../../memory/use-cases/uc.memory.cover.md) E2/E4).

## Quality notes

- **Why the icon is sealed while the tenant's *name* is not.** The name is cleartext because **at creation no
  key exists** under which it could be sealed — the Server Owner types it while the tenant is `PENDING`, and
  `K_SC` is not born until the invited owner activates
  ([uc.admin.create-tenant](../../admin/use-cases/uc.admin.create-tenant.md),
  [ADR 0006](../../../decisions/0006-cold-tenant-scope-birth.md)). That is a **mechanism necessity**, not a
  judgement that a name is harmless. An icon is set *after* activation, by a grant-holder — no necessity
  applies, so [ADR 0023](../../../decisions/0023-per-tenant-member-identity.md)'s rule binds: *only the
  plaintext the mechanism requires stays plaintext*. The asymmetry **is** the rule, not an exception to it —
  and it holds under SaaS, where veyq becomes the operator and a plaintext family photo would be worst.
- **The first sealed content on a TENANT row.** Until now a tenant scope row was pure opaque metadata plus
  ciphertext grants — deliberately *"anonymous, like personal"*. The icon ends that, and
  [en.spaces.tenant-scope](../enablers/en.spaces.tenant-scope.md) is where the change is recorded, not here.
  Note what is **not** claimed: the tenant's name stays cleartext. This is not a step toward a sealed tenant
  name, and nothing here should be cited as one.
- **Constant length — the leak is closed, not booked; and the cap is proven, not inherited.** A sealed
  *name*'s length leaks a handful of low-signal bytes. A sealed *image*'s length is close to a fingerprint of
  the image, and the tenant overview hands the operator one length **per tenant in a single response** — enough
  to correlate spaces that share a logo, which is exactly the SaaS threat sealing exists to answer. Padding to
  a constant costs a pad/unpad and removes the signal entirely. This is the repo's **first length-hiding
  rule**: the hard invariant lists *sizes* among the sanctioned opaque metadata, so booking the residual would
  also have been defensible — we spend three lines instead, because an image is not what that list had in
  mind. The padding pays a second time at the column: every opaque field in the schema is `TEXT`, which is
  **65,535 bytes on MariaDB and effectively unbounded on H2**, so an oversized value passes the entire test
  suite and fails only in production. Two fields of exactly that shape already exist
  (`identity_pins.sealed_blob` declares `@Size(max = 1048576)` over a `TEXT` column;
  `veyq_scope_favorites.ciphertext` declares `65536` against a 65,535-byte column). The icon must not become
  the third — and because its plaintext is a constant, its `@Size` is the **exact computed base64 length** of
  the sealed constant: one number, provably inside `TEXT`, inherited from neither neighbour.
- **A derived icon-key, like the name — and for the same reason.** `K_icon_e = HKDF(E_e, "space-icon-key")` is
  one-way, so handing it out leaks **the icon and nothing else** — no content, no dedup key. Nothing needs
  that today, and sealing directly under `E_e` would be equally forward-secret and simpler. It is chosen anyway
  because the group slice's obvious next question already has its answer built:
  [uc.spaces.consent-group-add](uc.spaces.consent-group-add.md) hands a pending invitee a wrapped
  `sealedNameKey` so they read the **canonical** name before accepting; an icon in that same preview is then a
  second wrapped key rather than an impossibility
  ([ADR 0027](../../../decisions/0027-group-invite-name-shared-key.md)). The info string is **distinct** and is
  pinned as a conformance vector
  ([ADR 0017](../../../decisions/0017-crypto-primitives-and-post-quantum-strategy.md)).
- **`iconEpoch` is forward-compatibility, not live mechanism.** It is bumped **only** by an icon-set; a plain
  rotation leaves it alone and readers peel down to it — the model
  [ADR 0027](../../../decisions/0027-group-invite-name-shared-key.md) established for `nameEpoch`. On a
  **tenant** it is `0` in practice today, because a tenant does not rotate on routine removal: removal is
  ACL-revoke, and the explicit owner-triggered *"re-key this space"* is **unbuilt**
  ([ADR 0025](../../../decisions/0025-forward-secrecy-policy-per-scope.md) — not ADR 0024, which owns the
  chain but not the tenant's policy). Carrying the index anyway is the posture
  [ADR 0024](../../../decisions/0024-scope-key-rotation.md) §3 already takes for the dedup key: omit it and the
  icon dies at the first re-key.
- **The owner gate comes free — and it is the one already got wrong once.** The tenant **root** scope is keyed
  `id == tenantId`, so `isScopeOwner(caller, scopeId)` against a `kind=TENANT` row **is** the tenant-owner
  check: no new query, and no opening to re-introduce the `tenantId`-only gate cr-0163 fixed as a privilege
  escalation ([ADR 0007](../../../decisions/0007-membership-role-grant-relation.md) — *the `tenantId` column is
  for belonging, never authorization*).
- **Reuse — including where the editor lives.** `TenantAvatar` already carries the `icon` prop, the `<img>` and
  its CSS: it is the swap point it claims to be. `deriveImage` already accepts a caller-supplied spec
  (`uploadCoverBlob` is the template). `useObjectUrls` owns the object URL, and here it is **mandatory** —
  unlike the group-name read, which returns only strings, this one returns decrypted **bytes**. The **editor's
  home** is already decided by what is built: a space's owner-only identity edit is an **inline header at the
  top of that space's members panel** — a group's rename lives in a `group-name-header` exactly there. The
  tenant's members panel has no such header, so the icon's home is **that header, mirrored one scope-kind up**,
  in the settings hub's tenant section. Not a new screen — an extension of a built pattern.
- **Three things this reuse does *not* get for free.** The cropper is **not** reusable as-is: it is inline in
  `MemoryCoverDialog.vue` and 16:9-hardcoded, and `CoverCrop` is a **type**, not a component — extracting it is
  real work, not a prop flip. The pixel stage is not ready either: `deriveImage` is **JPEG-only and fills no
  background**, so a transparent logo flattens onto an uninitialised (black) canvas — invisible for photos, its
  only use today; wrong for an icon. The icon encodes **WebP with alpha**, which needs a `mimeType` threaded
  through. And the **read needs the epoch chain, not the write key**: the members panel holds the active scope
  key (`E_current`), but opening an icon sealed at an older `iconEpoch` means peeling down to it — the same
  `keyAt(epochs, …)`-for-reads vs `writeKey(epochs)`-for-writes asymmetry the group name already has.
- **Trust tier — unchanged for the seal, widened for the read.** The seal's strength tracks
  [ADR 0026](../../../decisions/0026-client-trust-tiers.md) like all veyq E2EE; there is no icon-specific
  weakness. The **read** is what moves: rendering other tenants' icons means the switcher's origin receives
  every tenant's grant, so a malicious operator serving that client harvests keys for tenants the user never
  visits. That lands squarely in the tier ADR 0026 already books as lost, and not at all on a self-served
  client. The rule and its full reasoning live once, in
  [en.spaces.tenant-scope](../enablers/en.spaces.tenant-scope.md).

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** Give a space a **face**. As the owner of a family space or a group you pick a photo or a logo, frame
it, and it becomes that space's avatar for everyone in it — so the space you want is the one you *recognise*,
not the one you stop and read. The picture is locked on your device with the space's own key before it ever
leaves: the server stores a scrambled block, always the same size, so it cannot even tell a plain logo from a
family photo. A space without an icon simply shows its initial — nothing is ever picked for you.

**DE —** Gib einem Bereich ein **Gesicht**. Als Owner eines Familienbereichs oder einer Gruppe wählst du ein
Foto oder ein Logo, schneidest es zu — und es wird für alle darin zum Avatar dieses Bereichs. So *erkennst* du
den Bereich, den du suchst, statt ihn zu lesen. Das Bild wird noch auf deinem Gerät mit dem eigenen Schlüssel
des Bereichs verschlossen, bevor es überhaupt losgeht: Der Server speichert einen verwürfelten Block, immer
gleich groß — er kann nicht einmal ein schlichtes Logo von einem Familienfoto unterscheiden. Ein Bereich ohne
Icon zeigt einfach seinen Anfangsbuchstaben; ausgewählt wird nie etwas für dich.
