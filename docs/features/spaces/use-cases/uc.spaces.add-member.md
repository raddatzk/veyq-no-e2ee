# UC: Add a member to the shared Tenant space

- ID: uc.spaces.add-member
- Primary actor: Tenant **Owner** (invites — the only human action); **any tenant key-holder's device**
  completes the key delivery automatically.
- Goal: give another person access to the shared **Tenant** space — the owner invites them, and the tenant then
  hands over the key by itself: any member's device wraps the tenant scope key to the newcomer's identity,
  operator-blind.
- Preconditions: The owner holds the TENANT grant (born cold at activation, [ADR 0006](../../../decisions/0006-cold-tenant-scope-birth.md))
  to mint the invite; at least one key-holder (every member holds `K_SC`) comes online after the newcomer joins,
  to deliver the key; a way to deliver the invite secret out-of-band (email, as the owner invite already does,
  [cr-0009](../../../../changes/cr-0009-create-tenant-structural.md)).
- Postconditions (success): The invited person is a **member** of the tenant and, once **any** key-holder's
  device has wrapped the key to them, holds a **TENANT grant** — so they open the shared space instead of the
  Personal fallback. The server saw only the invite metadata, identity public keys, and opaque grant
  ciphertext — never the scope key.

This use-case is the first consumer of the grant-distribution primitive
([ADR 0020](../../../decisions/0020-grant-distribution-invite-wrap.md)); groups reuse the same primitive later.

## Main flow

1. The owner opens **"add member,"** enters the person's **email** and `role = MEMBER`. The server mints a
   **single-use member invite** (the secret hashed, never stored plaintext) and delivers it out-of-band —
   reusing the tenant-invite machinery that today mints only the owner ([cr-0009](../../../../changes/cr-0009-create-tenant-structural.md) / cr-0010).
   Delivery is by email **if a mailer is configured**, or by the owner **copying the invite link** the mint
   returns (the bootstrap secret in the URL fragment) — so member-add works with no SMTP, self-hostable by
   default ([cr-0080](../../../../changes/cr-0080-invite-link-handoff.md)).
2. The invitee opens the invite, previews the tenant (name, domain), and **registers**: their identity is
   **born cold on-device** and its public bundle published, they set their password + master-key wraps, and
   accept. They are now a tenant **member with no grant** — so they land in the **Personal fallback**
   ([uc.spaces.switch-spaces](uc.spaces.switch-spaces.md), [ADR 0019](../../../decisions/0019-token-less-tenant-home.md))
   and the Tenant entry reads *awaiting access*.
3. **Delivery is automatic — no second human action.** Every tenant member already holds `K_SC`, so **any**
   member's client — the owner's or another member's — that is online after the newcomer joined sees them
   *awaiting access* in the scope's **member directory** (with their identity public key) and **eagerly wraps**
   the key to them. The **first** key-holder to do so wins; the rest see the grant already present and no-op.
4. The wrap is `asymWrap(hybridPublic(member), K_SC, "scope-grant")` — the same hybrid KEM as a self-grant, only
   the recipient differs — run **on the key-holder's device** and posted as the member's grant; the server
   stores opaque ciphertext.
5. The member, on their **next entry**, opens their grant with their own identity private and reaches the
   shared **Tenant** space; the tree + favorites load for it ([uc.spaces.switch-spaces](uc.spaces.switch-spaces.md)).

## Alternate / exception flows

- **A1 — the invitee already has an account on this instance:** they **accept** rather than cold-register
  (the [cr-0010](../../../../changes/cr-0010-tenant-activation.md) accept branch); they still become a
  grantless member until a key-holder wraps (step 3). *(v1 tenant onboarding targets a new person by email; the
  existing-member, by-username variant is [uc.spaces.add-group-member](uc.spaces.add-group-member.md) — the group
  case under [ADR 0014](../../../decisions/0014-group-scopes-and-governance.md).)*
- **A2 — no key-holder is online when the member joins:** the member stays in the Personal fallback, surfaced as
  *awaiting access* — **not** an error. Only a key-holder can wrap the key; the blind server cannot. Access
  completes as soon as **any** member (the owner or another) is next online (step 3) — not specifically the owner.
- **E1 — the invite is expired / already consumed:** a generic failure; the secret is single-use.
- **E2 — key-substitution by a malicious operator:** the wrapping key-holder trusts the identity pubkey the
  server returns (v1 is *Plain*), so a malicious operator could substitute its own key and join the scope.
  Documented, bounded (self-hosted makes it moot; broadening *who* wraps doesn't widen it — one honest device
  would already have wrapped), and left with a hardening seam — see the quality note and
  [ADR 0020](../../../decisions/0020-grant-distribution-invite-wrap.md).
- **E3 — the member's grant won't unwrap** (corrupt / identity rotated without re-wrap): the member can't open
  the tenant → surfaced as an error; the scope row is **not** self-deleted (a blind operator must not force a
  wipe), matching [en.spaces.tenant-scope](../enablers/en.spaces.tenant-scope.md) E3.

## Quality notes

- **Operator-blind.** The member directory returns only **operational metadata** the server already stores
  (identity public keys, roles, grant-present flags); the wrap is **client-side**; the server stores the grant
  as opaque ciphertext. No scope key ever crosses the wire.
- **Member identity ([en.spaces.member-identity](../enablers/en.spaces.member-identity.md), cr-0083).** Each
  member shows a per-tenant **`username`** (plaintext handle, chosen at join, unique in the tenant) and their
  **real name sealed under `K_tenant`** — decrypted on-device by any member, never seen by the server;
  **`email` is owner-only** ([ADR 0023](../../../decisions/0023-per-tenant-member-identity.md)).
- **Auth ≠ content.** Onboarding makes someone a *member* (a role); it grants **no content**. Only the
  identity-unwrapped grant yields the key — a role without a grant is deliberately hollow
  ([ADR 0007](../../../decisions/0007-membership-role-grant-relation.md)), which is exactly the *awaiting
  access* state.
- **Admission vs. delivery.** The **owner** gates *who* joins (only the owner mints invites); **any** key-holder
  delivers the *key* (automatic, first-online-wins) — because every member already holds `K_SC`. A non-inviting
  member can't admit anyone; they only help hand the key to someone the owner already admitted. So access isn't
  bottlenecked on the owner, and no one is asked to confirm the same person twice (a second human checkpoint
  returns only if fingerprint verification is switched on later — [ADR 0020](../../../decisions/0020-grant-distribution-invite-wrap.md)).
- **The active-operator gap, stated honestly.** v1 trusts the server-returned pubkey (no TOFU-pin, no
  hard-gate). This matches the declared threat model — veyq does not defend an *actively malicious* operator
  before key transparency, and self-hosted makes it moot ([security-model](../../../crosscutting/security-model.md)).
  The identity **fingerprint / safety-number** derivation is left as an explicit seam for a later hardening
  slice ([ADR 0020](../../../decisions/0020-grant-distribution-invite-wrap.md)).
- **Additive only.** This use-case only **adds** a grant. Removing a member, rotating `K_SC` so a removed member
  can't read future content, and re-inviting are a separate later slice.

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** Your shared space starts as just yours; this is how you let others in. Invite someone by email — that's
your one decision. They set up their own account and land in their private space at first; then the key to the
shared space is handed over **automatically** — any member's device (yours or another's) seals a copy of the key
to the newcomer as soon as it's online, and from then on they see everything in the space. The key is wrapped
**on a member's device** straight to them: the server only passes along sealed data it can't read, and never
holds the key itself. Because a person, not the server, must hand over the key, a new member waits briefly in
their private space until *any* of you is next online — usually moments in an active space, and the price of the
server never being able to let someone in behind your back.

**DE —** Dein gemeinsamer Bereich gehört zuerst nur dir; so lässt du andere hinein. Lade jemanden per E-Mail ein
— das ist deine eine Entscheidung. Die Person richtet ihr eigenes Konto ein und landet zunächst in ihrem
privaten Bereich; dann wird der Schlüssel zum gemeinsamen Bereich **automatisch** übergeben — das Gerät
irgendeines Mitglieds (deins oder ein anderes) versiegelt dem Neuling eine Kopie des Schlüssels, sobald es
online ist, und ab dann sieht die Person alles im Bereich. Der Schlüssel wird **auf dem Gerät eines Mitglieds**
direkt an sie versiegelt: der Server reicht nur versiegelte Daten weiter, die er nicht lesen kann, und hält den
Schlüssel nie selbst. Weil ein Mensch — nicht der Server — den Schlüssel übergeben muss, wartet ein neues
Mitglied kurz in seinem privaten Bereich, bis *irgendjemand* von euch das nächste Mal online ist — in einem
aktiven Bereich meist nur Momente, und der Preis dafür, dass der Server niemand hinter deinem Rücken hereinlassen
kann.
