# UC: Remove a member from a tenant (with the group orphan rule)

- **ID:** uc.spaces.remove-tenant-member
- **Primary actor:** **TenantOwner** (`OWNER` on the TENANT scope, i.e. `scopeId == tenantId`). Rotating the groups
  the removed member merely co-shared is completed later by **any remaining group key-holder's device** (operator-
  blind — the server cannot rotate).
- **Goal:** remove a member from the tenant — **cut their access to shared + group content immediately**, hand over or
  wind down the groups they leave behind, and give them a **grace window to read their own memories** before those
  are erased. Not: snatch away everything they own the moment they leave.
- **Preconditions:** The caller is an **OWNER** of the tenant ([ADR 0014](../../../decisions/0014-group-scopes-and-governance.md) §4,
  [ADR 0007](../../../decisions/0007-membership-role-grant-relation.md)). The target is a current tenant member and
  **not the last tenant OWNER**.
- **Postconditions (success):** The target's **tenant-scope + shared-group** memberships are deleted (instant 403 on
  shared content). Groups they **solely owned** are **transferred** to the oldest remaining member, else
  **grace-tombstoned**. The target's **own** scopes (their personal scope + any group they were the *only* member
  of) are **grace-tombstoned but still readable by them** until the scheduled purge erases them. The tenant scope
  is **not** rotated ([ADR 0025](../../../decisions/0025-forward-secrecy-policy-per-scope.md) — ACL-revoke). The
  server saw only membership deletions + a lifecycle timestamp — never a key.

## Main flow

1. In the tenant's **members** panel ([uc.spaces.add-member](uc.spaces.add-member.md) directory), the TenantOwner
   picks a member and removes them.
2. The server checks the caller is a tenant **OWNER** and the target is **not the last tenant OWNER**
   (last-owner guard — a tenant keeps ≥1 owner, [ADR 0007](../../../decisions/0007-membership-role-grant-relation.md)).
3. **Immediate cut from shared spaces.** Delete the target's **TENANT-scope** membership and every **GROUP**
   membership where the group is **shared** (has other members). The target gets an instant 403 on all of it (ADR 0025 —
   the tenant content key is **not** rotated; ACL revocation is the layer).
4. **Orphan rule — groups the target *solely* owned** (they were OWNER, no other owner remains,
   [ADR 0014](../../../decisions/0014-group-scopes-and-governance.md) §6):
   - **Other members remain** → the **oldest remaining member** (earliest `createdAt`) is auto-promoted to OWNER; the
     group carries on under new ownership (a **server rule**, not a tenant-owner power — the owner never gains access).
   - **No member remains** (a solo group) → handled by step 5 (it's the target's own).
5. **The target's *own* scopes — grace-tombstone, keep read access.** The target's **personal scope** and any
   **group they were the sole member of** are **soft-deleted** (the cr-0090 grace + read-only + scheduled purge) —
   but the target **keeps their grant** on them. So the removed member can still sign in to the tenant and
   **read + download** their own memories (read-only) for the grace window; then the scheduled purge erases them.
   *Their own stuff isn't taken the moment they leave; shared stuff is.*

## Alternate / exception flows

- **A1 — last-owner guard.** The **last tenant OWNER** cannot be removed (a tenant needs ≥1 owner); the action is
  rejected. Promote another member to co-owner first.
- **A2 — a non-owner attempts a removal:** rejected — tenant-owner-gated (`403 not_tenant_owner`, enforced by code,
  [ADR 0008](../../../decisions/0008-centralized-http-auth.md)).
- **A3 — the target is not a tenant member:** `404 member_not_found`.
- **A4 — co-shared groups rotate via the async backstop (cr-0092).** For a group the target merely **co-shared**,
  the layer-1 cut (deleted membership → 403) is immediate, but the group's forward-secrecy **rotation** must run on
  a key-holder's device (client-driven — the removing tenant owner isn't necessarily even in that group). The
  removal **queues a `SCOPE_ROTATION` job** on the operator-blind task queue
  ([ADR 0021](../../../decisions/0021-operator-blind-background-tasks.md)); the next online remaining key-holder
  mints `E_{n+1}` + re-grants the survivors and completes it (reusing the cr-0089 rotation crypto). One live job
  per scope **coalesces** multiple removals; idempotent + first-online-wins. Not a hole: layer-1 already blocks new
  fetches; until rotation, the ex-member's old grant reads only pre-departure epochs (the "rotation queued until a
  key-holder is online" limit accepted for group removal, [en.spaces.scope-key-rotation](../enablers/en.spaces.scope-key-rotation.md) §E1).
- **E1 — already-downloaded content:** the target keeps whatever they saved locally — **not retractable** by any
  design. Removal (and the grace purge) erase the **server** copy, not what already left it.

## Quality notes

- **Operator-blind — and the server may do this work.** Removal is access-control + (for the target's own scopes)
  erasure, which the blind server may perform: it deletes memberships and flips `deletedAt` — **no key, no name, no
  plaintext**. The **tenant content key is not rotated** ([ADR 0025](../../../decisions/0025-forward-secrecy-policy-per-scope.md) —
  the tenant is the primary, potentially large content home; O(N) rotation-per-removal is the wrong default);
  groups rotate later, client-driven.
- **Humane erasure.** Reusing the cr-0090 grace + read-only + purge, the target's **own** memories (personal + any
  solo group) get a **read-only grace window** — they can look through + export them before they're gone. Only
  **shared** content is cut instantly.
- **Orphan rule = a rule, not a power.** The tenant owner never gains access to a group's content; ownership
  auto-transfers to the **oldest** remaining member (deterministic, no owner choice) or the group winds down
  ([ADR 0014](../../../decisions/0014-group-scopes-and-governance.md) §6).
- **Scope-generic reuse.** Soft-delete/grace/purge (`ScopeEntity.deletedAt`, `ScopePurge`, cr-0090) apply to the
  personal scope and solo groups unchanged — the only twist is **keeping the target's membership** so they retain
  read access during grace.

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** Removing someone from your space cuts them off from everything shared straight away — the shared tenant
space and every group they were in. A group they alone ran passes to its longest-standing member so it's never left
leaderless; if they were its only person, it winds down on the same 30-day timer as a deleted group. Their **own**
private memories aren't snatched away the instant they leave: they keep **read-only** access to look through and save
them for 30 days, and only then are they erased. You never gain access to anyone's private group — the handover is
automatic.

**DE —** Jemanden aus deinem Bereich zu entfernen trennt sie sofort von allem Geteilten — dem gemeinsamen
Tenant-Bereich und jeder Gruppe, in der sie waren. Eine Gruppe, die sie allein geführt haben, geht an ihr
langjährigstes Mitglied, damit sie nie führungslos zurückbleibt; waren sie die einzige Person, läuft sie auf
demselben 30-Tage-Timer aus wie eine gelöschte Gruppe. Ihre **eigenen** privaten Erinnerungen werden ihnen nicht im
Moment des Entfernens entrissen: sie behalten **30 Tage** lesenden Zugriff zum Durchsehen und Speichern, erst danach
werden sie gelöscht. Du bekommst nie Zugriff auf die private Gruppe von jemandem — die Übergabe ist automatisch.
