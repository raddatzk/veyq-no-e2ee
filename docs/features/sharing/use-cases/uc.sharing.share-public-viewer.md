# UC: Share a Memory as a public viewer link

- **ID:** uc.sharing.share-public-viewer
- **Primary actor:** **a curator** — the owner of a **personal-scope** Memory (holds its `K_mem`).
- **Secondary actor:** **an anonymous viewer** — no account, no identity keypair.
- **Goal:** publish **one** of your own Memories as a **read-only, anonymous, revocable** link that anyone with the
  link can open — while the server stays operator-blind and the rest of your content stays private.
- **Preconditions:** an **authenticated, unlocked** curator; the target Memory is in the caller's **personal scope**
  (v1 restriction); the caller can open it (holds `K_mem`).
- **Postconditions (success):** a share record exists server-side (opaque), and a link `/s/{shareId}#k=<K_share>` opens
  the Memory subtree read-only for any anonymous visitor — until the curator revokes it or it expires. Operator-blind
  throughout: the server never sees `K_share`, `K_mem`, any name, the viewer, or which media the viewer opens.

This is the first sharing slice ([ADR 0029](../../../decisions/0029-public-viewer-share.md)): **public viewer
only**. Contributor/uploader writes, password protection, and public-sharing of group/tenant Memories are later
slices. The crypto is the per-Memory second-wrap of [ADR 0012](../../../decisions/0012-content-key-hierarchy.md).

## Main flow

1. **Create.** The curator opens one of their Memories → **Share** → *create public link*. The client generates a
   fresh 32-byte `K_share`, computes `symWrap(K_share, K_mem)`, re-seals the **Memory name under `K_share`**, and
   `POST`s the share record `{ nodeId, role: VIEWER, wrap, sealedName, expiresAt? }`. The server mints a **256-bit
   `shareId`** and stores the record opaquely.
2. **Hand off.** The client shows the link **`/s/{shareId}#k=<base64url(K_share)>`** to copy. `K_share` lives in
   the **fragment** — never sent to the server. The curator passes it out-of-band (message, QR, wherever).
3. **Open (anonymous).** A visitor opens the link. The client `GET`s `/api/shares/{shareId}` (**no auth**) → the
   record **plus the sealed subtree** (the Memory node + its chapters + media metadata, all sealed under `K_mem`).
   The client **unwraps `K_mem` with the fragment key**, decrypts names/layout/metadata **locally**, and renders
   the Memory **read-only**.
4. **View media.** For each blob the client calls the **share-scoped, gated** blob endpoint; the server authorizes
   it **iff the blob is attached under the shared subtree**, returns a **presigned store URL**, and the client
   fetches the bytes **directly from the object store** and decrypts them locally.
5. **Manage / revoke.** The curator can list their shares and **revoke** one (`enabled = false`) or set an expiry;
   the next visitor request then `404`s.

## Alternate / exception flows

- **A1 — expiry:** a share past its `expiresAt` resolves `404` (same shape as an unknown id — non-enumerable).
- **A2 — revoked:** `enabled = false` → the resolve **and** the gated blob endpoint `404`; a visitor who already
  downloaded ciphertext can still replay *that*, but gets nothing new (no key rotation — see Quality notes).
- **E1 — link without the fragment key:** the `shareId` alone is **inert** — the server returns the wrapped key,
  but without `K_share` the client cannot unwrap `K_mem`, so nothing decrypts. Both halves are required.
- **E2 — wrong / guessed id:** unknown `shareId` → `404`. The 256-bit id is unguessable; there is no enumeration.

## Quality notes

- **Operator-blind.** The server stores only `shareId`, the wrap `symWrap(K_share, K_mem)`, the plaintext `role`,
  the `K_share`-sealed name, and `nodeId`. It never sees `K_share`, `K_mem`, a name, the viewer, or — because
  blobs are fetched direct-from-store — **which media a viewer opens**.
- **Least-privilege, crypto-enforced.** A share exposes **only that one Memory subtree**: `K_mem` is random and
  independently wrapped, so the link reveals neither `K_SC` (the rest of the scope) nor any sibling Memory's
  `K_mem` ([ADR 0012](../../../decisions/0012-content-key-hierarchy.md)).
- **Client-integrity trust tier ([ADR 0026](../../../decisions/0026-client-trust-tiers.md)).** The crypto keeps
  the operator blind, but a **no-install viewer is served as operator-controlled web code** — so against an
  **actively malicious, foreign** operator, confidentiality depends on client integrity (it could serve tampered
  JS that captures the fragment key). This is **not** shouted in the viewer; the page carries a **footer link to
  veyq's security documentation** (the single source of the trust model). For the **default self-hosted** case
  (operator = curator) the gap is **moot**; a foreign-operator-proof viewer needs the future trusted-web client.
- **Revocation is soft (L1); already-read is not retractable.** Revoke/expiry stop *new* access (resolve + gated
  blobs `404`), but content a visitor already downloaded cannot be pulled back — a stated limitation.
- **Scope rotation ≠ share revocation.** A share is independent of `K_SC`, so a scope key rotation does **not**
  close it. In **cr-0100's v1 this could not arise** (personal scope has no member removal); group/tenant sharing —
  where a member IS removed — is now [uc.sharing.share-shared-scope](uc.sharing.share-shared-scope.md) (cr-0104),
  which soft-revokes the removed member's shares as the honest-server revocation ([ADR 0029](../../../decisions/0029-public-viewer-share.md) §6).

## What this means for you / Was das für dich bedeutet

**EN —** You can turn one memory into a link and send it to anyone — a grandparent, a friend, a group chat — and
they just open it in a browser, nothing to install, no account. Only someone with the **exact** link can see it,
and it shows them **only that one memory** — never the rest of your space. You can switch the link off whenever you
like. One honest note: on the web, this is as private as your trust in whoever runs your veyq server — if that's
you (self-hosted), it's fully private; the little "how safe is this?" link in the footer explains the details.

**DE —** Du kannst eine Erinnerung in einen Link verwandeln und ihn an irgendwen schicken — Oma, eine Freundin,
einen Gruppenchat — und sie öffnen ihn einfach im Browser, ohne Installation, ohne Konto. Nur wer den **genauen**
Link hat, sieht sie, und er zeigt **nur diese eine Erinnerung** — nie den Rest deines Bereichs. Du kannst den Link
jederzeit abschalten. Eine ehrliche Anmerkung: im Browser ist das so privat wie dein Vertrauen in den, der deinen
veyq-Server betreibt — bist das du selbst (self-hosted), ist es voll privat; der kleine „Wie sicher ist das?"-Link
im Footer erklärt die Details.
