# ADR 0012 — Content-key hierarchy: per-Memory keys, random and many-wrapped

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-28

## Context

[ADR 0002](0002-personal-scope-per-tenant.md) settled
the **scope** layer (opaque `scopeId` + kind; a member holds a scope via a grant = the scope key sealed to
their identity). What lives *inside* a scope — folders, Memories, chapters, media, journal — needs its own
key model. The [Security Model](../crosscutting/security-model.md) **sketched** per-subtree content keys and
"a share = one subtree content key wrapped to a per-share key" (its hierarchy diagram now names this ADR's
per-Memory `K_mem`); the crypto vectors pin a `contentKey`-based `slug_token` / `chunk_frame` /
`dedup_token` / `journal_open`. The open question was the **exact granularity and wrapping** — and specifically: *how do you share a single Memory without exposing the rest
of the scope?* This ADR nails it. (Considered and rejected during refinement: **one content key per scope** —
sharing one Memory would hand out the whole-scope key, leaving the confidentiality of the *other* Memories to
**server gating, not crypto**; and **a full per-subtree key tree** — maximal flexibility but a deep key
hierarchy + re-wrap-on-move complexity the product doesn't need.)

## Decision

**Content keys are per Memory — random, and wrapped to many recipients.** Three layers under the scope:

1. **`K_SC` — scope content key (one per scope, rotatable in epochs — [ADR 0024](0024-scope-key-rotation.md)).**
   Obtained by a member by **opening their grant** — the grant's plaintext *is* the scope's current epoch key;
   there is no key in between. It is the **navigation root**: node **names**
   (folder / Memory / chapter titles), paths and the **blinded slug tokens** (`slug_token`) key off the scope's
   **current content-epoch key**, so a member who holds the scope decrypts the **whole tree's structure + names
   with one key** — without touching any Memory's content. (The per-scope **dedup token** is the one exception: it
   keys off a **stable, non-rotating** scope sub-key so identical blobs still deduplicate across epochs, [ADR 0024](0024-scope-key-rotation.md).)
2. **`K_mem` — per-Memory content key (one per Memory, a fresh random 32-byte key).** Wrapped under `K_SC`
   for members. Encrypts that Memory's **content** — chapter bodies, journal, sensitive metadata
   (capture time, location) — and **wraps that Memory's `K_blob`s**. A Memory is the **unit of sharing**
   (recursively, so is a chapter — see *Recursive `K_mem`* below).
3. **`K_blob` — per-blob key (one per media blob, random).** Wrapped under its Memory's `K_mem`; encrypts the
   media blob's `chunk_frame`s. Lets a Memory's media be keyed independently (and dedup tokens stay per-scope).

**Folders carry no key** — they are pure organization. A folder's *name* is navigation metadata under `K_SC`
like any node; it has no content key.

**`K_mem` is RANDOM, not derived from `K_SC` — so it is "one key, many wraps"** (the same pattern as the
Master Key, [ADR 0005](0005-unlock-methods-and-device-trust.md)). This is the crux that makes per-Memory
sharing **cryptographically** enforced:

- **Members:** `K_mem` is wrapped under `K_SC` (`symWrap`). Every scope member opens it.
- **Sharing one Memory adds an *independent second wrap* of that same `K_mem`** — never `K_SC`:
  - **Public link share:** `symWrap(K_share, K_mem)` where `K_share` is a fresh per-share key whose secret
    rides the **URL fragment** (never the server); the shared Memory's name travels in the share record too,
    re-sealed to `K_share`. A guest opens **only** that Memory.
  - **Member share** (a *registered* recipient gets ongoing access to one Memory):
    `asymWrap(recipientIdentityPub, K_mem)` — the **same identity-targeted grant as a scope grant (ADR 0020),
    but scoped to a single Memory's `K_mem`** instead of the whole scope's `K_SC`. Opened with the recipient's
    identity private key — no link, no fragment key (unlike the public link above, which shares one Memory
    *anonymously*). A capability of the independent-second-wrap model; **not a built feature** (no use-case yet).
- Because `K_mem` is random, handing a recipient `K_mem` reveals **neither `K_SC`** (so not the rest of the
  scope) **nor any other Memory's `K_mem`** (each is wrapped under `K_SC`). Least-privilege is **crypto-
  enforced**, not server-gated.

**Rotation / revocation.** Removing a share record is instant (server-side, no keys). The eventual crypto
defense is **rotating the affected key**: a single Memory by re-sealing its content under a fresh `K_mem`
(re-wrapped to members); the whole scope by **rotating `K_SC` forward into a new epoch** — re-wrap the new epoch
to the remaining members, new content seals under it, nothing existing is re-encrypted (the epoch chain,
[ADR 0024](0024-scope-key-rotation.md)). Already-read content cannot be retracted — a stated limitation.

**Operator-blind, unchanged.** The server stores only ciphertext content + the opaque wraps (`K_mem`-under-
`K_SC`, share wraps), node ids/parents/kinds/ordering/timestamps, and the blinded slug/dedup tokens. It never
holds `K_SC`, `K_mem`, `K_blob`, or any name.

## Consequences

- **Per-Memory sharing works without exposing the scope** — the question this ADR was opened to settle: a share is one extra wrap of the
  Memory's `K_mem`; `K_SC` stays in the owner-circle.
- **Cheap navigation, scoped content.** One `K_SC` decrypts the whole tree's names/structure; a Memory's
  content needs its `K_mem`. A guest of a shared Memory sees that Memory's name + content and nothing else.
- **`cross-space-memory-move`** ([memory](../../changes/) note): moving a Memory across scopes is a
  copy + re-encrypt (new scope's `K_SC`/`K_mem`), never a tree move — consistent with [scopes & tenancy](../crosscutting/scopes-and-tenancy.md).
- **Per-Memory rotation is possible** precisely because `K_mem` is random + wrapped (a derived key could not
  be rotated without rotating `K_SC`).
- **Cost:** one wrap (`K_mem`-under-`K_SC`) per Memory + one per `K_blob`; a share adds one wrap per share.
  Negligible vs. content size.
- **Deferred to the implementation CR / vectors:** the exact wire formats (already partly pinned —
  `slug_token`/`chunk_frame`/`dedup_token`/`journal_open` in `contracts/crypto/vectors/v1.json`) and the
  share-record shape. (A chapter carries its **own recursive `K_mem`**, not the parent's — see *Recursive
  `K_mem`* below.) Group/recipient key-directory trust is the active-operator gap already in the Security Model.
- **Media dedup — decided in [ADR 0013](0013-blob-storage-presigned-direct-to-store.md): declined.** `K_blob`
  stays **random** (so this ADR's wording holds) and the `dedup_token` vector stays unused: any storage-saving
  dedup would leak the scope-internal blob-equality structure to the blind operator. Scope-wide convergent
  dedup remains a possible *future* slice, not a default.

## Recursive `K_mem` — a chapter carries its own key

A **chapter is itself a Memory**, so it carries the **same kind of key, applied recursively** — there is
no separate `K_chapter` type:

- **Every content-bearing node (MEMORY *and* CHAPTER) has its own random `K_mem`,** wrapped under the
  **content key of its parent**: a top-level Memory's `K_mem` under `K_SC`; a chapter's `K_mem` under its
  **parent Memory's `K_mem`** (same `content-key` wrap context, one level deeper). **Folders still carry no
  key.** This is *not* the "full per-subtree key tree" rejected above — only content nodes get a key, and the
  shape follows the existing Memory model unchanged.
- **`K_blob` is wrapped under the `K_mem` of the media's *direct* parent node** — media on a chapter under the
  chapter's `K_mem`, media on the Memory under the Memory's `K_mem`.
- **Every content node is therefore a sharing unit.** Sharing one chapter = one extra wrap of *that* chapter's
  `K_mem`; it reveals neither the parent's `K_mem` nor `K_SC`. Sharing the whole Memory transitively unwraps
  its chapters (their keys are wrapped under its `K_mem`) — a Memory share includes its chapters; a chapter
  share never leaks upward.
- **Moves are a single re-wrap, never a data re-encrypt:** moving media chapter↔Memory re-wraps only its
  `K_blob`; moving a chapter between Memories re-wraps only that chapter's `K_mem` (its subtree is untouched).

**Rejected — a chapter shares its Memory's `K_mem`:** separate **per-chapter sharing** is a product goal, and
for E2EE data bolting it on later would force a client-side **re-encryption migration** of every chapter's
media (only the client can re-key). Paying one extra wrap per chapter avoids that. The operator stays blind: it
holds one more opaque wrap and nothing else.
