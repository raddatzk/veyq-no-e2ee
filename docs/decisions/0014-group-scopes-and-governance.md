# ADR 0014 — Group scopes & governance: shared scopes, private even from the tenant owner

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-28

## Context

The [spaces feature](../features/spaces/_index.md) always planned **groups** ("create / join a group"). The
foundation is in place: scope identity (opaque `scopeId` + `kind` TENANT/GROUP/PERSONAL,
[ADR 0002](0002-personal-scope-per-tenant.md) + [en.spaces.personal-scope](../features/spaces/enablers/en.spaces.personal-scope.md)),
membership = role + grant ([ADR 0007](0007-membership-role-grant-relation.md)), the hybrid-KEM grant
([ADR 0017](0017-crypto-primitives-and-post-quantum-strategy.md)), and the content-key hierarchy
([ADR 0012](0012-content-key-hierarchy.md), where a scope's `K_SC` is already "one key, many wraps"). A group
is therefore **mostly a multi-member scope** — little new crypto. What is *not* yet settled, and what this ADR
nails, is the **governance**: who may do what, how members are added operator-blind, the group lifecycle, and
— the question that drove the refinement — **what relationship, if any, a tenant owner has to groups**.

Considered and rejected during refinement:

- **Tenant owner can see all groups in the tenant (read-only oversight).** Rejected. Visibility without any
  capability is **surveillance, not governance** — and group existence + membership are *already* server-side
  metadata the invariant sanctions (the server must hold scope + membership rows to route grants), which on a
  **self-hosted** instance the tenant owner — frequently also the operator — can read at the DB level anyway.
  A product feature would add UI + a "the admin watches your groups" signal for **zero new power**, while the
  real guarantee (names + content sealed) holds regardless. Dropped entirely.
- **Tenant owner can force-delete a group, or add themselves to one.** Rejected — both break the core promise
  that a group is confidential *even from a privileged tenant role*. The only legitimate need behind them —
  **orphaned groups** when an owner leaves the tenant — is met by an automatic rule, not an admin power (below).
- **Plaintext group name stored server-side.** Rejected — a leak; the name is sealed under `K_SC` like any
  node name ([ADR 0012](0012-content-key-hierarchy.md)).
- **Email-invite outsiders as the first way to add a member.** Deferred (not rejected) — start with
  **username search of existing tenant members** (their identity public key already exists); email-invite
  onboarding is a later, heavier flow.
- **Server-computed group navigation / a server-side group slug.** Rejected — like the personal scope, groups
  are addressed and navigated **client-side**: the `@group` URL fragment resolves against the member's own
  decrypted group list ([ADR 0015](0015-operator-blind-readable-urls.md)).

## Decision

**A group is a `kind=GROUP` scope, born warm by an existing tenant member, whose members each hold a grant —
and which is confidential even from the tenant owner.**

1. **Birth (warm, client-driven).** An existing, unlocked tenant member (the **GroupOwner**) mints it like a
   personal scope ([en.spaces.personal-scope](../features/spaces/enablers/en.spaces.personal-scope.md)) but
   **named + multi-member-capable**: generate a random `K_SC`, **seal the group name under `K_SC`**, and
   `asymWrap` `K_SC` to their **own** identity public key (the self-grant). `POST` the ciphertext name + grant;
   the server mints the `GROUP` scope + the creator's `role=OWNER` membership. No new crypto — the KEM grant of
   [ADR 0017](0017-crypto-primitives-and-post-quantum-strategy.md), the content keys of [ADR 0012](0012-content-key-hierarchy.md).

2. **Key distribution = one grant per member.** A member holds the group iff a membership row carries `K_SC`
   `asymWrap`'d to *their* identity public key. Adding a member is exactly: produce that grant and `POST` it.
   The server never holds `K_SC`.

3. **The name is sealed under `K_SC`.** Only members decrypt it. The server — and anyone with server/DB access,
   including a self-hosting tenant owner — sees an **unnamed** group: opaque `scopeId`, `kind`, members. This is
   what makes a group **private even from the tenant owner**.

4. **Authority model.**

   | Role | May |
   |---|---|
   | **GroupOwner** (`OWNER` on a GROUP scope) | create the group · **add members via username search** · **promote a member to co-owner / demote a co-owner** · **delete the group with a grace period** |
   | **Member** (any role with a grant) | read + write the group's content (holds `K_SC`) |
   | **TenantOwner** | **nothing** with respect to groups — groups are **not surfaced** to them, and they cannot delete a group or add themselves |

   Only two roles — **OWNER / MEMBER** (no `ADMIN`; an admin-over-groups would be surveillance for zero power,
   above). A group follows the cross-cutting ownership rule ([ADR 0007](0007-membership-role-grant-relation.md)):
   **multiple owners allowed, at least one required** — the last owner cannot be removed or demoted (the
   last-owner guard); a sole owner leaving the tenant triggers the orphan rule (§6).

5. **Adding a member = username search + consent.** The GroupOwner searches by **username** — a **per-tenant,
   unique-within-tenant** handle ([ADR 0023](0023-per-tenant-member-identity.md)), not email; the server resolves
   it to the target's **identity public key**.
   - **The resolve is owner-gated, but that is not an enumeration barrier.** Any tenant member can create a group
     and become its owner in O(1), so the username → identity-public-key → consent-flag resolve is effectively
     available to *every* tenant member. This is deliberate and within the metadata model (per-tenant usernames +
     identity pubkeys are tenant-visible, [ADR 0023](0023-per-tenant-member-identity.md); the consent flag is the
     one honest low-sensitivity exception). The owner-gate is convenience, not confidentiality — code and contract
     must not present it as the latter.
   - **Default = direct add.** The owner picks the member → the server records a grant-less GROUP membership →
     grant-delivery ([ADR 0021](0021-operator-blind-background-tasks.md)) wraps `K_SC` to them, first-online-wins
     ([ADR 0020](0020-grant-distribution-invite-wrap.md)). They simply find themselves in the group.
   - **Optional consent (a per-user "ask before adding me" toggle) is consent-first, never wrap-then-soft.** A
     non-auto-join member is *proposed*, held as a **soft, grant-less** membership; grant-delivery **skips** soft
     memberships, so **`K_SC` never reaches someone who hasn't accepted** (deleting an already-delivered wrap
     would not un-give the key — so we gate *before* the wrap, not clean up after). To let them decide informed,
     the owner's device hands the invitee the group's **derived name-key `K_name`** (wrapped to their identity,
     `asymWrap(inviteePub, K_name, "group-name-key")`) so the invitee opens the scope's **canonical** sealed name —
     the same ciphertext the members read — and **cannot** be shown a divergent, owner-typed name. This replaces the
     original **one-off name-seal** (an unverifiable owner-supplied name a modified owner client could make diverge);
     the derivation, the forward-secrecy, and the rejected alternatives are settled in
     [ADR 0027](0027-group-invite-name-shared-key.md). The invitee sees the (group-consistent) name + who added them;
     **Accept** flips the membership eligible → a key-holder wraps `K_SC` (the usual "awaiting access" window);
     **Decline** drops the soft membership (nothing was ever wrapped).
   - **Threat:** a malicious operator could return a public key it controls (MITM) and read the group.
     **Defense:** the **safety-number / fingerprint** of that identity. The verification stance is settled in
     [ADR 0028](0028-identity-authenticity-tofu-verification.md): **TOFU-pin on first use**, a **change** is a UI
     notice (accept → re-pin) or a **hard block for the human-less grant-delivery worker**, and out-of-band
     **safety-number verification** (QR compare) elevates *pinned* → *verified*; a **hard gate** before the first
     grant is available as an **opt-in strict mode**. The pin store is client-side + sealed (operator-blind).

6. **Lifecycle.** Settled in the lifecycle slice ([uc.spaces.delete-group](../features/spaces/use-cases/uc.spaces.delete-group.md), G3b):
   - **Owner delete = soft + grace.** Any GroupOwner deletes; the group enters **pending-deletion** (`deletedAt`
     marker + a `purgeAfter` date) and is hard-purged by a scheduled job after a **30-day grace period** (`P30D`,
     reusing the tenant-invite retention precedent). Mirrors the scheduled-purge pattern (`TenantInvitePurge` /
     `SessionPurge`). **During grace the group stays
     viewable + downloadable but read-only, clearly marked as deleting** (members can see their pictures one last
     time); grants/memberships are untouched, so **any owner can restore** in-window (trivial: clear the marker).
     The **hard-purge erases content + blob objects** from the store (reusing the blob-aware node-subtree delete),
     not just DB rows — the erasure the [security-model](../crosscutting/security-model.md) mandates. Purge is a
     **server job** (operator-blind-safe: it deletes only ciphertext + opaque rows + blobs, never a key/name),
     unlike removal's key rotation.
   - **Orphans = an automatic rule, not an admin power.** When a user is removed from a tenant, a group they
     **solely** own is **transferred** — ownership passes automatically to the **oldest remaining member**
     (the **oldest remaining member** by membership `createdAt`, promoted to OWNER); if **no** member remains, it is
     **grace-tombstoned** (same soft-delete as above). A server rule, so no tenant-owner snooping power is needed.
     Its trigger is **tenant member-removal** ([uc.spaces.remove-tenant-member](../features/spaces/use-cases/uc.spaces.remove-tenant-member.md)):
     removing a member cuts their **shared** access at once (ADR 0025 — no tenant rotation), but their **own** scopes
     (personal + any solo group) are **grace-tombstoned with read access kept**, so they can read/export their own
     memories for the window before erasure — their stuff isn't taken the instant they leave. The rotation of groups
     they merely co-shared is client-driven and completed later by a remaining member (the async backstop).
   - **Removal → rotation.** A removed member keeps the content key they already held; confidentiality of **new**
     content is restored by **rotating the scope key forward into a new epoch** — re-grant it to the remaining
     members, seal new content under it, **nothing existing is re-encrypted** (the epoch chain,
     [ADR 0024](0024-scope-key-rotation.md)). "Stop new grants + rotate forward"; already-read content cannot be
     retracted (a stated limitation).

7. **Group favorites are per-user under the identity key, not `K_SC`.** The favorites blob
   ([en.memory.favorites](../features/memory/enablers/en.memory.favorites.md)) seals under `K_SC` for a personal
   scope, but `K_SC` is **shared** in a group, so a group's per-user favorites must seal under the **member's own
   identity key** to stay private to them. Folded in when favorites reach group scopes.

## Consequences

- **Groups reuse the content stack.** The Memory tree ([ADR 0012](0012-content-key-hierarchy.md)), browse, and
  (with the identity-key caveat) favorites work per-scope already — a group is "another scope" to them.
- **Confidential even from the tenant owner.** The strongest practical privacy statement veyq makes: a group's
  *content and name* are sealed; only its *existence + membership* are visible to whoever runs the server, and
  the product surfaces neither to the tenant owner.
- **No new crypto, no new operator trust.** Member grants are the same hybrid KEM; the only new server state is
  the GROUP scope row's sealed name + the per-member grants + the pending-deletion lifecycle.
- **Sliced delivery.** **G1** — create + open + browse a group (solo owner; this ADR's substrate,
  [en.spaces.group-scope](../features/spaces/enablers/en.spaces.group-scope.md)). **G2** — add a member
  (username search + KEM grant + the fingerprint stance). **G3** — member management, grace-period delete +
  orphan rule, key rotation.
- **Deferred, on purpose:** the fingerprint verification stance (G2), grace length + restore + rotation
  mechanics (G3), and email-invite onboarding (later). They are recorded here so the slices inherit the frame.
