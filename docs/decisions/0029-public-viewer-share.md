# ADR 0029 — Public viewer share: a sealed per-share key + an anonymous access path

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-08

## Context

Sharing lets a curator hand **one Memory** to people **outside** the scope — including **anonymous visitors
with no veyq account and no identity keypair**. (Sharing *with* a registered veyq user is already what groups /
scope grants do; the new job of "sharing" is reaching non-members.) The **crypto** for this is already pinned in
[ADR 0012](0012-content-key-hierarchy.md): a share adds an **independent second wrap of that Memory's `K_mem`** —
for a public link, `symWrap(K_share, K_mem)` with a fresh per-share key `K_share` whose secret rides the **URL
fragment**, never the server. Because `K_mem` is random and wrapped independently, a share reveals **neither
`K_SC`** (the rest of the scope) **nor any other Memory's `K_mem`** — least-privilege is crypto-enforced.

What is **not yet decided** is the **share resource** and the **anonymous access path**: the server-side record
shape, how an account-less viewer resolves and decrypts a share, how blobs reach them operator-blind, revocation,
and the **client-integrity honesty** that a no-install web viewer forces ([ADR 0026](0026-client-trust-tiers.md)).
This ADR decides those. It is the first sharing slice — **read-only public viewer only**; contributor/uploader
writes, password protection, persisted shares and notices are later slices.

## Decision

Adopt a **public viewer share** as a standalone, operator-blind resource addressed by an unguessable link.

1. **The share resource (opaque server state).** A share record holds: a **256-bit random `shareId`**
   (base64url, unguessable — the id is half the capability), the wrap **`symWrap(K_share, K_mem)`**, the fixed
   **`role = VIEWER`**, the shared Memory's **name re-sealed under `K_share`**, the **`nodeId`** of the shared
   Memory (the subtree root, used only to gate blob reads), `enabled`, and an optional `expiresAt`. The server
   **never** sees `K_share`, `K_mem`, any name, or the viewer — only ciphertext + these opaque fields.

2. **The link.** `/s/{shareId}#k=<base64url(K_share)>` — `K_share` lives in the **fragment**
   ([ADR 0015](0015-operator-blind-readable-urls.md)) and is never transmitted. Access needs **both** the id (from
   the path, seen by the server) **and** the key (from the fragment, not seen) — one without the other is inert.

3. **Anonymous resolve.** `GET /api/shares/{shareId}` is **unauthenticated** and returns the record **plus the
   sealed subtree** (nodes + media metadata under `nodeId`, all still sealed under `K_mem`). The viewer unwraps
   `K_mem` with the fragment key, then decrypts names, layout, media metadata and blob frames **locally**. This is
   a **parallel authorization path keyed on share state** — never a relaxed tenant/scope filter.

4. **Blob access, gated + direct-from-store.** A share-scoped endpoint authorizes a blob GET **iff the blob is
   attached under the shared subtree** (a structural check on opaque ids) and returns a **presigned store URL**
   ([ADR 0013](0013-blob-storage-presigned-direct-to-store.md)); the viewer fetches bytes **directly from the
   object store**, so the operator never learns which media a viewer opens.

5. **The whole subtree.** A share covers the Memory **and everything under it** — its chapters and attached media
   (the subtree rooted at `nodeId`), not just the single node.

6. **Scope of shareable content: any scope the caller is a member of** (personal, **group**, or **tenant**). A
   member may public-share **any Memory in a scope they belong to** — not only their own personal Memories. The
   two shared-scope questions the earlier v1 cut deferred are **decided**, not sidestepped:
   - **Who may publish — any member.** Content in a shared scope belongs to all members, and any member could
     already reach an outsider by other means; a public link is a member capability, not an owner-only one. (This
     is a *capability*, still `AND`-ed with the instance's `sharing.public-links` / `sharing.uploader-links`
     capability, [ADR 0032](0032-capability-discovery-version-gating.md), and the role-`AND`-scope gate.)
   - **Member removal — deactivate the removed member's shares.** Removing a member **soft-revokes every share
     that member created** in that scope (`enabled = false`, §7). The share is **not** deleted: **any remaining
     member may re-activate it, which transfers its ownership** to the re-activating member — so an active share
     is always tied to a *current* member's responsibility, never orphaned to a removed one. This deactivation is
     the **honest-server forward-secrecy layer for a public link**: because `K_mem` is stable and never re-keyed
     (Consequences — *scope rotation does not revoke a share*), a link **cannot be rotated away**, so the
     server-side soft-revoke *is* the revocation. It composes with, and is independent of, the scope-key rotation
     that member-removal also triggers for a **group** ([ADR 0024](0024-scope-key-rotation.md)); the **tenant**,
     which revokes by ACL rather than rotation ([ADR 0025](0025-forward-secrecy-policy-per-scope.md)), relies on
     this deactivation as its **only** forward layer for a public link.

   A **personal** scope has no member removal, so only the first slice's crypto/access-path (§1–§5, §7–§8) applies
   there; the governance above is inert for it.

7. **Revocation is soft (L1).** `enabled = false` / deleting the record → the next guest request `404`s; an
   `expiresAt` in the past `404`s. The same soft-revoke fires **automatically on member removal** for the removed
   member's shares (§6), and a re-activation flips `enabled` back on (transferring ownership). There is **no
   content-key rotation** for a viewer share: already-downloaded ciphertext (and a saved fragment link) cannot be
   retracted — a **stated limitation**, consistent with [ADR 0012](0012-content-key-hierarchy.md) (already-read
   content is never retractable). Heavier defense (re-seal under a fresh `K_mem`) stays available but is not part
   of viewer-share revoke.

8. **Client-integrity honesty (the trust tier), surfaced by reference.** The crypto keeps the operator blind — the
   server never sees `K_share`. But a **no-install viewer is served as operator-controlled web code**, so
   confidentiality against an **actively malicious, foreign** operator depends on client integrity: such an
   operator could serve tampered JS that captures the fragment key ([ADR 0026](0026-client-trust-tiers.md)). This
   is **not** surfaced as an explicit in-viewer caveat (noise for the reader, and the honest model must not be
   duplicated per-page); instead the viewer page carries a **footer link to veyq's security documentation**, the
   single source of the trust model. For the **default self-hosted deployment the operator *is* the curator**, so
   the gap is **moot**. A fully operator-proof public viewer against a *foreign* operator is gated on the future
   **trusted-web client** (inbox #53) / SaaS (#41) and is **out of scope** here.

## Consequences

- **Least-privilege is crypto-enforced**, not server-gated: a leaked share exposes exactly one Memory subtree,
  never the scope or a sibling Memory.
- **New server-visible operational surface** (all non-sensitive): the opaque `shareId`, the wrapped key, the
  plaintext `role`, and the `K_share`-sealed name. No content, no identity, no viewer.
- **Scope rotation does not revoke a share.** A share wraps `symWrap(K_share, K_mem)`, independent of `K_SC`.
  Removing a scope member rotates `K_SC` forward (a new epoch, [ADR 0024](0024-scope-key-rotation.md)) but leaves
  `K_mem` — and therefore the share — **untouched**: the publicly-shared Memory keeps working, **including content
  added after the removal** (new blobs seal under the same stable `K_mem`). So a removed member who kept the link
  keeps reading until the **share is revoked separately** (soft revoke → the resolve + gated blob GET `404`, after
  which they can only replay already-downloaded ciphertext). *Scope rotation ≠ share revocation* — two distinct
  surfaces. This is consistent (the Memory was **deliberately** made public), but it breaks the naive expectation
  that "removing a member cuts their access to everything" — which is exactly **why member removal auto-deactivates
  the removed member's shares** (§6): since `K_mem` cannot be rotated away, that server-side soft-revoke is the
  only revocation available, and it is the honest-server forward layer that makes group/tenant sharing sound.
- **T&S "decryptable-on-report" corollary** ([security model](../crosscutting/security-model.md)): an abuse report
  necessarily includes the full share URL — hence the fragment key — so an operator **can** decrypt a **reported
  public** share. Private, unshared content stays unscannable; this is the intended, honest asymmetry.
- **New contract** `contracts/api/sharing.openapi.yaml` (create/list/revoke for the curator; the unauthenticated
  resolve + gated blob GET for the guest). Blob bytes reuse the ADR 0013 presigned direct-to-store path.
- **Built since:** contributor/uploader writes ([ADR 0030](0030-contributor-public-share.md) /
  [ADR 0031](0031-uploader-public-share.md)); public-sharing of **group/tenant** Memories (point 6, this revision).
- **Deferred, each with its own dependency:** password protection (fold `Argon2id(passphrase)` into the wrap key);
  persisted shares / person-resolution; notices / tenant terms; and the foreign-operator-proof no-install viewer
  (trusted-web / SaaS).

## Alternatives considered

- **Member share first** (`asymWrap(recipientIdentityPub, K_mem)`, [ADR 0012](0012-content-key-hierarchy.md)) —
  an identity-targeted grant to a *registered* user. Deferred: it overlaps what groups already do (share with
  veyq users) and is not the product-defining "reach someone outside" capability. It stays a crypto earmark, not
  a built feature.
- **An explicit in-viewer trust-tier warning** — rejected in favor of the footer link: the honest model belongs
  in one place (the security docs), and a per-page caveat is noise that most viewers can't action.
- **Binding public sharing entirely to the trusted-web client / SaaS** — rejected: the self-hosted default
  (operator = curator) makes a public viewer sound **today** with honest labelling; withholding it until SaaS
  would deny the core self-hoster their primary sharing use for no gain in their threat model.
