# ADR 0031 — Uploader public share: a write-only drop-box with a client-local, session-only own-view

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-07

## Context

[ADR 0030](0030-contributor-public-share.md) built the **CONTRIBUTOR** public share (view + add photos) on a
sealed anonymous identity + a share-scoped upload path, and split out the **UPLOADER** variant. This ADR decides
it: a **write-only drop-box** — a curator turns one Memory into a link where anyone can **add photos but cannot
see the Memory's existing content** (nor other contributors'). It is the classic "collect photos from guests
without them seeing each other / your library" flow (cf. Nextcloud *File Drop* / *File request*).

The whole upload machinery is reused from ADR 0030 (the sealed identity, `POST /identities` + `/blob-uploads` +
`/media`, the shared optimistic-upload queue). What is **not yet decided** is: how *"cannot see others"* is
enforced operator-blind, what the uploader **does** see, and how they **delete their own** — without the server
gaining a per-identity content-listing surface.

## Decision

Adopt an **UPLOADER** role as a write-only share, with a **session-scoped, client-local** view of one's own
uploads and a token-gated **delete-own**. **v1: role UPLOADER, personal scope, direct-append.**

1. **`canView` gate — a write-only role has no *read* capability, at every read endpoint.** The gate matrix is
   `canView = { VIEWER, CONTRIBUTOR }`, `canUpload = { CONTRIBUTOR, UPLOADER }`, and it is enforced on **both**
   guest read paths, not just the resolve:
   - The anonymous resolve (`GET /api/shares/{shareId}`, [ADR 0029](0029-public-viewer-share.md)) returns, for an
     UPLOADER share, only `role` + `wrap` + `sealedName` — **`media: []`, `nodes: []`, `identities: []`**. The
     client seals its uploads under `K_mem` (from `wrap`) and shows the title (from `sealedName`); it needs
     nothing from the subtree, so not even the root node is served (returning it would hand the uploader that
     node's `K_mem`-decryptable `wrappedMeta`).
   - The blob download (`GET /api/shares/{shareId}/blobs/{blobId}`) is **role-gated too** — an UPLOADER share
     `404`s **before** the subtree check, so even a leaked in-subtree blob id yields nothing. Write-only is thus a
     **real server capability**, not merely id-secrecy.

   "Cannot see others" is therefore enforced by the server *not exposing*, on top of being structural (an uploader
   is never handed anyone else's ids; ids are unguessable — 256-bit `shareId`, 122-bit media/blob UUIDs).

2. **The own-view is client-local — no server read, no gallery filtering.** An uploader still sees the photos
   **they themselves add this session** (the product wants the familiar gallery look). This is done **client-side,
   not by a filtered server read**: on each upload the client keeps the returned `{ mediaId, blobId }` **plus the
   local preview** (the picked file's own bytes) in **session memory**, and renders them with the **same gallery
   mechanic** (the shared `MediaGrid` + optimistic tiles) from those local previews. The uploader **never
   downloads** anything, and the server **never** exposes a "list my contributions" endpoint — so *"see your own"*
   needs **no per-identity server-side filtering**. (The `mediaId`/`blobId` are unguessable **identifiers**, not
   capabilities — they do not authorize anything by themselves; the authority is the `contributorToken`, point 4.
   Their unguessability only matters in that an uploader never *learns* another guest's ids — see point 1.)

3. **Session-only, ephemeral by design.** Because the own-gallery lives only in the browser tab's memory (local
   previews + the in-memory id list), **a reload / new tab shows nothing** — the uploader's prior uploads are not
   re-listed or re-fetched. This is a deliberate privacy stance (the write-only guarantee is strongest when the
   guest holds no durable handle to server content) and matches Nextcloud's drop model. It is a **sharp UX edge**,
   so the uploader flow must **warn prominently and repeatedly** that the view is session-only (see point 5).

4. **Delete-your-own (token-gated, ownership-checked).** `DELETE /api/shares/{shareId}/media/{mediaId}` carries the
   contributor token (header); the server deletes the media + reclaims its blobs **iff** the media's
   `share_identity_id` equals the token's identity. This single-row ownership check is *not* gallery filtering —
   it is the correct authorization for a destructive op, and it keeps the endpoint safe even if a future role
   (a CONTRIBUTOR, who *does* see others' ids) is allowed to delete. `canDeleteOwn = { UPLOADER }` in v1
   (CONTRIBUTOR delete is a later add over the same endpoint). Delete is reachable only **in-session** (after a
   reload the client no longer holds the id) — consistent with point 3.

5. **Prominent ephemerality warning (a hard requirement of this slice).** The write-only, session-only nature must
   be unmistakable, surfaced in **four** places: (a) on the mandatory **name pre-screen**, before the first upload;
   (b) a **persistent badge** in the uploader header (in place of the viewer's "read-only" badge) — *"visible only
   in this session"*; (c) a dedicated **empty-state after a reload** (not a blank gallery) — *"your earlier
   uploads aren't shown here, for privacy; they arrived safely — you can add more"*; (d) a note that **delete
   works only in this session**. The plain-language "What this means for you" section states it too.

6. **Everything else inherits ADR 0030.** Mandatory display name **sealed under `K_mem`** → an anonymous share
   identity; the share-scoped, token-gated upload path; direct-append to the shared root (the curator sees the
   contributions in *their* gallery); the byte budget + per-share rate limit; the client-integrity trust-tier
   honesty (footer link, [ADR 0026](0026-client-trust-tiers.md)); personal-scope-only; the T&S
   decryptable-on-report corollary.

## Consequences

- **The most operator-blind sharing surface yet.** The server serves the uploader **no gallery at all** — the
  resolve returns `media: []` / `nodes: []` and the blob endpoint is role-gated to a `404`. It holds the same
  opaque state as a contributor share (the sealed identity + the `share_identity_id` stamp) — needed only for the
  curator's own view + the delete ownership check — never a content listing (or a served byte) for the guest.
- **Ephemeral own-view is a real UX limitation.** An uploader who adds 20 photos, reloads, and expects to manage
  them will find an (intentional) empty state. The four-point warning (point 5) is the mitigation; it is why this
  is a *decision*, not just a UI detail. Persisting the id list client-side (`localStorage`) to allow post-reload
  **delete** — without re-showing thumbnails — is a **possible later add** (a "manage my uploads" affordance); it
  is deliberately **out of v1** to keep the write-only guarantee simple and the promise honest.
- **Attribution self-asserted; direct-append; scope-rotation ≠ share-revoke; personal-scope-only** — all inherited
  unchanged from [ADR 0030](0030-contributor-public-share.md) / [ADR 0029](0029-public-viewer-share.md).
- **New server surface (small):** the resolve gains a role branch (empty media for UPLOADER); one new endpoint
  (`DELETE …/media/{id}`). No new table, no new crypto vector.

## Alternatives considered

- **Server-side identity-filtered gallery for the uploader** (the resolve returns *only this identity's* media,
  keyed on the token). Rejected: it gives the server a **per-identity content-listing** surface and makes the
  read path token-authenticated + filtered — more surface, less blind — to buy post-reload persistence the product
  doesn't need. The **client-local own-view** (point 2) delivers the same in-session own-gallery with **zero**
  server-side filtering.
- **A persistent client-local id list (`localStorage`) with targeted own-download after reload.** Rejected for v1:
  it would re-show thumbnails across reloads by **downloading the uploader's own blobs by id** — breaking the clean
  "an uploader never downloads" guarantee — for a convenience the drop-box use-case doesn't require. Kept as a
  clearly-scoped later option (persist ids for *delete*, still no download).
- **A pure write-only form with no own-view at all** (the strict Nextcloud *File Drop*). Rejected as the default:
  the product wants the familiar gallery look for *what you just added*; the session-local own-gallery (point 2)
  gives that at no server cost, and the warning (point 5) keeps the ephemerality honest. (This strict form is a
  trivial subset should we ever want it.)
