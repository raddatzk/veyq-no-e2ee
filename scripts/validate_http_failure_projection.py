"""Guard the single-source HTTP failure projection (audit #72 / P3b, ADR 0042).

Every backend operation's `…Outcome` failure variant projects to the wire `ErrorResponse{code}` through the
**one** `shared/http/` envelope writer (`httpError`), never a per-resource `Response.status(...).entity(
ErrorResponse(...))` or a hand-rolled `error()/forbidden()/notFound()` helper. That is what keeps the status +
code single-sourced (on the variant / the `Failures` catalog) and makes drift structurally impossible.

The enforceable invariant, promoted from cr-0161's one-shot proof grep to a permanent check:
  `ErrorResponse(` is CONSTRUCTED in exactly one file — the shared writer `shared/http/HttpFailure.kt`.

Any other `backend/src/main` file that constructs an `ErrorResponse` has bypassed the shared writer and can drift
the status/code for a failure the rest of the codebase routes through `httpError` — so it fails this guard.
