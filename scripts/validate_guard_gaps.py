"""Pin the documented gaps of the other guards, so the trust-chain skill's gap-map can't silently rot.

The other `validate_*.py` assert that a reference *resolves*, never that what it points at carries weight —
the `trust-chain` skill maps exactly where each stops. That map used to live as prose derived by reading guard
code (`SKILL.md`), which is a *remembered* claim wearing a command's clothes: tighten a validator to close a
gap and the prose goes silently false. That is the repo's recurring "Trap 5" (a remembered claim drifting from
reality), one level up — and it bought this guard.

So each documented gap becomes an **executable** assertion instead of a sentence. For every case below the
guard: copies the working tree into a throwaway dir (heavy dirs excluded), confirms the target validator is
**green on the un-forged copy** (else an unrelated red would masquerade as "the gap holds"), injects one
forgery, runs the real validator as a subprocess, and asserts its exit code is the documented one. The real
tree is never touched — every guard resolves `ROOT` as `__file__.parent.parent`, so running the *copied*
`scripts/<guard>.py` binds it to the copy; restoration is "delete the tempdir" (an abort leaves only an
orphaned tempdir, never a dirty tree — the automated evolution of `changes/README.md` § bite-proof).

The coupling is the point: if someone tightens a validator to close a gap, the documented pass/fail flips and
**this guard goes red** — forcing the closure to be recorded in `SKILL.md`, not landed silently. When that
happens the fix is *not* to relax this guard blindly: confirm the gap really closed, then move the skill's map
and this table together.

Scope — nine file-based cases: four the guard must **reject** (a closed hole, pinned so it can't silently
re-open) and five still-**open** gaps (the limit is documented, not yet closed). Two further documented gaps
stay out on purpose (below).

Rejected — regression-pins for closed holes (a forgery the guard must now catch):
  1  a web coverage ref at a *non-test* file — closed: a web ref must exist AND match *.test|*.spec, so a real
     `package.json` no longer resolves (validate_coverage `WEB_TEST_RE`)
  2  a backend ref at an *empty `fun` body* — closed: the resolved method's body is now read; an empty `{}`
     block is rejected, while a `= expr` expression body still counts (validate_coverage `_kotlin_funs`)
  4a a coverage `status: done` — rejected: the enum permits only unset/`planned`, so a loosened enum bites
  7  a base64 field's `maxLength` pushed above 65 532 (more than a `TEXT` column holds) on a non-allowlisted
     field — rejected: `validate_maxlength_storage` ties every base64 cap to its storage, so the #94 class
     (a cap larger than its column) can't silently re-enter
Open gaps — a forgery the guard still passes (a documented limit, not a defect to fix blindly):
  4b a lying `status: planned` on an implemented use-case passes. **Left open on purpose** — the obvious rule
     "planned ⇒ no coverage refs" is *false*: `uc.spaces.verify-identity` is legitimately `planned` yet carries
     a real ref (`identityPins.test.ts`), a partially-built use-case. The narrow decidable rule ("every criterion
     covered ⇒ planned is a contradiction") shuts only the *full* evasion, never the partial ("cover 5 of 6, mark
     planned, skip the 6th"), so it is much mechanism for one theoretical lie. This counter-example is the whole
     reason 4b stays open — recorded here, beside the case, so nobody re-derives the false rule from scratch.
  5  a CR marked `status: done` with no implementation passes (validate_changes: enum + refs, nothing more)
  6  a link to a non-existent `#fragment` anchor in an existing file passes (validate_doc_links strips it)
  8  a *free-text* (non-base64) `maxLength` blown past what its column holds passes — `validate_maxlength_storage`
     reasons only about base64 caps (char == byte), never free-text byte-width (`chars × up-to-4` under utf8mb4)
     nor columns that serialize several capped fields (`terms_markdown_by_locale`). **Left open on purpose** —
     catching it needs the field→column map the guard deliberately does not carry (a manifest that rots); the
     one real free-text-on-`TEXT` column was instead *widened to MEDIUMTEXT* in #94, closing that instance by
     construction. The gap is the class, not that column.
  9  rate-limit state in a limiter named neither `*Limiter*` nor `*Counter*` passes `validate_ratelimit_core`,
     which matches on the **filename** (ADR 0052). **Left open on purpose** — the reach of a buildless grep *is*
     the naming convention, and no grep can enforce a name that has not been written yet; closing it needs the
     reflection sweep the posture guard already pays for, which would leave this glob entirely. Pinned so the
     limit stated in that guard's docstring is executable rather than a sentence.
  10 a mutated policy that gains a dependency on a file no `paths:` filter lists passes
     `validate_mutation_trigger_paths` — it derives one path per manifest entry and cannot follow imports, so
     editing that dependency alone moves a mutation score without triggering the gate. **Left open on purpose**
     — a path filter is a *file* trigger; following imports would mean a Kotlin dependency graph in a buildless
     Python guard, and the honest alternative (widen the filter to the four scope directories) costs ~70 files'
     worth of no-op mutation runs against the 10 that are in scope. Pinned so the limit in that guard's
     docstring is executable rather than a sentence.
Out of reach by construction, not deferred work: the mutation **total-vs-per-glob** asymmetry (needs a report
fixture + git, so it belongs to a mutation-job-local test, not this buildless glob) and the **rate-limit posture
sweep** (ADR 0051). The sweep is a JVM test — it enumerates JAX-RS endpoints by reflection over compiled classes
and a live CDI container — so this guard, which forges *files* and runs a *Python* validator as a subprocess,
has no way to inject into it. Its boundary (green proves every endpoint **declares** a posture, never that a
domain-keyed limiter **fires**) is therefore held where it can be: in the sweep's own docstring, in the
`trust-chain` skill's gap-map, and in `docs/crosscutting/cc.security.rate-limit.md`. (The other historical deferral here —
CR-number reuse against history, old inbox #107 — is *gone*, not deferred: CRs are named by slug, not an
allocated number, so there is no number to reuse and nothing to guard. See `changes/README.md` § naming.)

A `validate_*.py`, so the trust-chain glob runs it on every push with no build. Runnable locally:
