"""Every class the backend mutation gate mutates must also TRIGGER it.

**What it asserts.** For each entry in `backend/pitest.scope.json` (`targetClasses` + `targetTests`), derive
the `.kt` file it names — package → directory, class → filename, a trailing `*` stripped — and assert that
file (a) exists on disk and (b) is listed in **both** `paths:` blocks of
`.github/workflows/mutation-backend.yml`. The two blocks are checked **separately, not as a union**: Actions
supports no YAML anchors, so the PR filter and the main-branch backstop are hand-duplicated and can drift
apart — which is exactly the failure this guard exists for. A **subset** check: the blocks legitimately also
list the manifest, `build.gradle.kts`, the meta-checks and the workflow itself, and extra entries are not this
guard's business.

**The defect that bought it — measured, not hypothetical.** `a8cc4ce4` (2026-07-19) created the workflow when
the scope held three classes; the list was correct. `b15807a7` (2026-07-20) added `ShareAccessPolicy` and
`MembershipPolicy` to the manifest and did **not** touch the workflow (`git show --stat b15807a7 | grep -c
mutation-backend.yml` → 0). From that day a PR touching **only** one of those two classes never triggered the
assertion-strength gate at all — the check silently did not run on exactly the change it exists for. The
workflow's own comment asserted the opposite (*"a new policy enters via a pitest.scope.json edit, which is
listed here, so adding one always triggers the gate"*): true for the adding commit, false for every later edit
to that class. The manual list broke on the first policy added after it existed, one day later. Inbox #114.

Enforcing the manifest's *"an EXPLICIT list, never a package sweep"* rule falls out for free: a package glob
(`com.veyq.app.features.*`) derives no filename and is rejected here with that reason named.

**Its limit — a path filter cannot cover transitive dependencies.** `MembershipPolicy` imports
`shared.membership.MembershipEntity`; `RemovalPolicy` imports that plus `spaces.scope.ScopeEntity`. A change
to those moves a mutation score without touching any listed path, and no path-based trigger list can see it —
this is a principled limit of the mechanism, not a hole to plug (pinned as a case in
`validate_guard_gaps.py`). Two narrower ones: it proves a path is **listed**, never that GitHub Actions
actually dispatches on it (a malformed filter elsewhere, or a disabled workflow, is outside); and it says
nothing about whether the gate, once triggered, is strict enough — that is
`mutation_meta_check_backend.py`'s job and the build's `mutationThreshold`.

Buildless and diff-free, so it belongs in the trust-chain glob (unlike its two `mutation_meta_check*.py`
siblings, which need a built report and therefore run from the mutation jobs).
