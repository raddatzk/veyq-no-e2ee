"""Per-glob meta-check for the backend mutation gate (ADR 0045 §4) — two assertions, one per hole the
build's aggregate `mutationThreshold` leaves open.

**What it asserts.** For every `targetClasses` glob in `pitest.scope.json`, read out of PIT's report:

1. **Non-empty** — the glob matches > 0 mutations. PIT's `failWhenNoMutations=true` already fails the build
   when the *whole* scope mutates nothing; the delta here is one stale glob among healthy siblings. A policy
   renamed while its glob is left behind (or a typo'd glob) then matches *nothing*, `failWhenNoMutations`
   stays green because the siblings carry the run, and that class loses its mutation coverage unnoticed.
2. **Survivor budget** — at most `SURVIVOR_BUDGET` undetected mutants, and at least one detected one. This is
   the per-member sibling of `mutationThreshold`, which is a score over the **whole** scope and so lets a weak
   class pass on its siblings' mutants.

**The defects that bought them.** (1) no incident — built with the gate itself (ADR 0045 §4) because a
whole-scope signal structurally cannot see a single stale member; `ai/README.md` rule 3 is the standing
reason. (2) **a real one, inbox #116:** the first `./gradlew pitest` after `TokenBucket` entered the scope
scored **56/58 = 97 %** and the build was **green** against the calibrated threshold of 95, while
`TokenBucket` — the one class the change was about — was **23/25 = 92 %** on its own, with *both* survivors
inside it. Nothing said so. Found only by running the gate; every structural check was green throughout.

**Why a count and not a percentage.** [backend/build.gradle.kts] justifies `mutationThreshold.set(95)` as
deliberate headroom for one *future* equivalent mutant (one PIT cannot prove equivalent, so it surfaces as
SURVIVED). Applied per class that same 95 % is unreachable: at the scope's measured sizes — 3, 6, 9, 15 and
25 mutants — a single survivor scores 66.7/83.3/88.9/93.3/96.0 %, so a per-glob 95 % floor would mean **100 %
for four of the five classes** and abolish the very headroom it was copied from. A budget of one undetected
mutant states the same intent independently of class size, and does not need re-tuning as the scope grows.

**The undetected set is PIT's own, not a hand-rolled status list.** A mutant counts as a survivor here when
its `detected` attribute is not `"true"`. Measured against PIT 1.19.4's `DetectionStatus.isDetected()`:
KILLED, TIMED_OUT, **NON_VIABLE**, MEMORY_ERROR and RUN_ERROR are detected; SURVIVED, NO_COVERAGE, NOT_STARTED
and STARTED are not. So a non-viable mutant — reported but never a real survivor — is excluded for free, and
an uncovered one correctly counts against the budget. Re-measure with:

    javac -cp <pitest.jar> Probe.java && java -cp <pitest.jar>:. Probe   # prints each status + isDetected()

**Their limits.** (1) proves a glob matched *something*, never that what it matched is the class the manifest
meant. (2) tolerates exactly one undetected mutant per glob **by design**, so a single genuinely-weak
assertion per class stays invisible; and it cannot tell an *equivalent* mutant (unkillable — no fix exists)
from a *missed* one, which stays a human call because PIT cannot make it either. Neither says anything about
code outside the manifest — the dumb stores and the `@QuarkusTest` slices are excluded on purpose (ADR 0045
§2), so a green run here is a claim about the pure decision tier and nothing else.

Deliberately diff-free — a stale glob points at nothing regardless of what a given PR changed, so the
invariant holds on every run, not only when the diff intersects the scope. It reads the SAME manifest the
`pitest{}` build block consumes (backend/pitest.scope.json), so the mutator and this guard never disagree on
WHAT is in scope.

Not a `validate_*.py`: the trust-chain job runs those on every push with no build, but this needs PIT's
`mutations.xml`, which only the mutation CI job produces — so it is invoked from that job, not the glob. It is
a permanent guard all the same, standing alongside the build's `mutationThreshold`. Runnable locally after a
`./gradlew pitest`:
