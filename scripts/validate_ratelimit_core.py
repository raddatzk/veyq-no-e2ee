"""Guard that rate-limit state lives in exactly one place: `backend/.../shared/ratelimit/` (ADR 0052).

**What it asserts.** No file under `backend/src/main/kotlin` whose name contains `Limiter` or `Counter` holds
rate-limit state — a concurrent map, a hand-rolled map, an atomic counter — unless it sits inside the shared
`shared/ratelimit/` package. Plus the inverse, so the check cannot pass by pointing at nothing: the shared
package must itself still hold that state (a renamed or emptied core makes this red instead of vacuously green).
One core, one shell, one place where a bucket is stored.

**The defect that bought it.** Rate limiting arrived four times in a row, each time with its own map and its own
arithmetic: a per-IP filter, `ShareRateLimiter`, `SharePasswordAttemptLimiter` (its own `Window` data class and
inline window maths) and `InviteMailRateLimiter` (two maps of its own, over borrowed arithmetic). Two consequences
were measured, not feared. The **window-boundary burst** — an attacker timing a burst across the wall-clock slot
edge lands 2× the cap — reached `ShareRateLimiter` silently, because it was a property nobody had written down in
any of the four copies. And both hand-rolled maps were **unbounded**, while the shared shell had had a bounded key
set since the day it was written; a flood of spoofed keys grew them without limit. `cr-ratelimit-posture` reduced
four to two by hand and `cr-token-bucket-rate-limit-core` two to zero — and a count in a deleted CR proves nothing
about tomorrow, which is why the completeness proof is this file rather than that tally
(`changes/README.md` § promote one-shot proofs).

**Its limit.** This is a **filename + symbol text grep**, deliberately: it is decidable without a build, so it
runs in the buildless trust-chain glob on every push (unlike the JVM-reflection posture sweep of ADR 0051, which
`./gradlew check` owns). Three things it therefore does not see:
  1. a limiter that **avoids both name parts** — `ShareThrottle.kt`, `GuestBudget.kt` — evades it entirely. That
     gap is pinned open, executably, in `validate_guard_gaps.py`; the naming convention is the only thing that
     makes the grep reach, and no grep can enforce a name nobody wrote yet.
  2. **re-implemented arithmetic without state** — a `retryAfter` computed inline in a handler, borrowing no map.
     Green here means "the state lives in one place", never "the maths lives in one place".
  3. the **test** tree, excluded on purpose: a test may hold whatever state it needs to drive a limiter.

A `validate_*.py`, so the trust-chain glob runs it on every push with no build. Runnable locally:
