"""Pin the mutation meta-checks' documented total-vs-per-glob asymmetry (inbox #109, ADR 0045 §4).

Two sibling guards, deliberately different:
  - `mutation_meta_check.py` (crypto/web): asserts the report's **TOTAL** mutant count > 0, and only when the
    PR diff intersects the mutate scope — StrykerJS OSS has no diff scoping, so a total-0 on a touched scope is
    a broken run, not a correctly-empty one.
  - `mutation_meta_check_backend.py`: asserts **each** `targetClasses` glob is individually > 0, on every run —
    PIT's `failWhenNoMutations` already covers the global-empty case; the delta is one stale glob whose
    non-empty siblings keep the build green.

That asymmetry lives only in the two docstrings: make the backend check total-count, or the web check per-glob,
and the prose goes silently false (the repo's recurring "Trap 5"). This selftest makes it executable — the same
"one member empty, a sibling full" fixture must be **rejected** by the backend check and **accepted** by the web
check (total still > 0).

Why it is not a `validate_*.py`: the web check shells out to `git diff`, but the trust-chain glob's harness
(`validate_guard_gaps.py`) copies the tree **without** `.git` (none of its targets reads history) — so a
git-dependent check cannot live there (cr-0180). This fabricates its own Stryker/PIT reports **and** a throwaway
git repo, so it needs no real mutation run; it is invoked from `mutation.yml` / `mutation-backend.yml` beside the
real checks. Runnable locally:
