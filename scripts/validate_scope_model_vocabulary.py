"""Guard the scope model's vocabulary — docs name the model the code actually implements (cr-0166, cr-0168).

Three phantoms had drifted into `docs/`: an `ADMIN` role, an asymmetric scope keypair, and an `ACTIVE`
membership state. All three were worse than a gap — a reader who *checked* was confirmed in the wrong belief.
cr-0166 corrected the first two, cr-0168 the third; this guard is why none can silently return.

Unlike cr-0162/0163 — where the defect was a *condition* inside a query, and only a probe test could hold it —
this invariant **is** vocabulary: certain nouns must not appear in `docs/` because the things they name do not
exist. A grep expresses it exactly, so a grep is the guard.

Four invariants:

1. **No scope keypair.** `K_SC` is a forward chain of random 32-byte content-key epochs (ADR 0024); a grant is
   `asymWrap(memberIdentityPub, E_latest, "scope-grant")` — asymmetric *transport* of a **symmetric** payload,
   pinned at 32 bytes by `contracts/crypto/vectors/v1.json` (`asym_scope_grant.plaintext`). So a "scope
   private/public key", a "scope keypair", and a `wrappedScopePrivateKey` field are all phantoms. The phrases
   have **no** legitimate use — the *identity* keypair and the *invite-wrapping* keypair are both real and both
   named differently — so this is a flat zero-hit check with no allowlist.

2. **No `ADMIN` role.** The vocabulary is `OWNER` / `MEMBER` at every level (Server, Tenant, Group — ADR 0007,
   ADR 0014). The one legitimate use is the **negative** form ("no `ADMIN`"), which is precisely the signpost a
   future reader greps for — so that, and only that, is allowed. Rewording those ADRs to make this grep simpler
   would destroy the signpost and is not an acceptable fix for a red here.

3. **No `ACTIVE` membership state.** Four documents said server authorization required "a valid grant + `ACTIVE`
   membership". There is no membership status column and never has been — `MembershipEntity` is
   `(userId, scopeId, tenantId, role, wrappedGrant)`, and a membership **is** the row's existence. The real gate
   is the membership boundary first, then the key-holder check (ADR 0042, cc.security.authorization).

   **The phantom is `ACTIVE` applied to a *membership*, never the word itself** — and that distinction is the
   whole check. `ACTIVE` is a live state on two other axes: the **tenant** lifecycle (`PENDING → ACTIVE`,
   ADR 0006) and the **invite** lifecycle (`ACTIVE → SUPERSEDED / CONSUMED / EXPIRED`), 8 legitimate lines across
   4 files at cr-0168. A flat check on the word reds every one of them and would push someone to reword the real
   tenant lifecycle to satisfy a grep — the same failure mode invariant 2's signpost carve-out exists to avoid.
   So this keys on `ACTIVE` sitting **adjacent** to a membership word, with only whitespace/emphasis between.

   **Line-scope is a proxy for clause-scope.** The
   line this was written for carried both a phantom and a legitimate state at once —
   `owner = ACTIVE tenant-owner; tenant = ACTIVE` (`uc.admin.create-tenant.md`, a diagram step) — so a line
   cannot be judged as a whole. Two costs, both real and accepted: a phantom phrased without any of these words
   is invisible here, and a line that legitimately puts a lifecycle `ACTIVE` next to a membership word reds
   falsely. **The fix for a false positive is to split the claim, not to weaken the check.**

4. **The role constants match the contract.** `MembershipEntity`'s role constants equal the role enum in
   `contracts/api/scopes.openapi.yaml`. This is what makes cr-0166's deletion of the dead `const val ADMIN`
   stick: it fails the day a third constant returns, and it needs no allowlist either.

Scope note: the vocabulary checks read `docs/` **state** only and skip `docs/inbox.md`, which is *flow* — raw
topics that may quote the old wording while pending (docs/ai/README.md, state vs. flow). Every cr-0166 and
cr-0168 confirm-command excluded it too.
