"""Guard that `scripts/run_web_e2e.py` cannot report success having run zero e2e files.

**What it asserts.** Three things, all about the orchestrator's discovery step:
  1. `discover()` finds at least one `*.e2e.test.ts` in the real `web/` tree, and everything it returns really is
     an e2e file. This half exists so the guard cannot pass by pointing at nothing — the same failure it guards.
  2. `discover()` on a tree with no e2e files **raises** `NoE2eFilesError` rather than returning `[]`. An empty
     list would flow through `main()` as "0 files, 0 failures, exit 0".
  3. Nothing swallows that error: the no-arg path in `main()` goes through `discover()`, and the module's only
     `except NoE2eFilesError` re-raises it as a `SystemExit`. A raise that is caught and logged would put the
     defect back.

**The defect that bought it.** An orchestrator reporting green because it ran nothing is indistinguishable from
one whose suites all passed, and this exact claim has already been false once in this repo: ADR 0040's
*Correction (2026-07-14)* records a coverage table headed **Measured** that claimed `run_web_e2e.py` ran when the
file did not exist, and four `web`/`e2e` coverage refs were riding on it. Those refs come back only on a green CI
run — so "green" must be unable to mean "nothing ran". `changes/README.md` § a bite test must tell "the guard
held" apart from "nothing ran" is the general form.

**Its limit.** It reaches discovery and nothing downstream. A green run here does NOT prove that the stack came
up, that a backend booted, that a database was fresh, or that any assertion in any suite executed — those need
Docker and a built jar, so they cannot live in the buildless `validate_*` glob, and the `web-e2e` CI job is their
only enforcement: a red job is that guard. Assertion 3 is also **textual**, not semantic: it reads the module's
source for the swallow-shapes it knows, so a novel way to swallow the error (catching a base class, a bare
`except`) would pass it. That is the price of staying buildless; the two behavioural assertions above are not
textual.

Note it does not copy the repo the way `validate_guard_gaps.py` does. It does not need to: `discover()` takes its
root as a parameter, so an empty `tempfile` directory is already the throwaway tree, and nothing is ever injected
into the live one.
